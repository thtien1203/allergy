In the meanwhile you can cover it over the body by wearing appropriate long clothes which can cover most of the body to hide it. If itching occurs then you can take cetirizine once daily to prevent itching. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. Wishing you good health.,1,,

4,"I have a background of hay fever which gets quite severe with an almost contantly runny nose and mild asthma. I find it quite hard to tell the difference between allergies and a cold. for a week now i have had varying symptoms which started with sneezing, a runny nose (extremely so!), there was a slight sore throat with it, and i now have a slight cough and a little breathlessness. There has been no fever but i do work in child care, germ central. unless i have a fever im never sure if i have a cold or allergy and im not sure if the breathlessness is asthma symptoms or not. thankyou","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Allergies and common cold can be associated with similar symptoms. The main differences would be fever, change in appetite or energy level that may occur with the common cold. The time frame would also vary, if the symptoms are acute then it is more likely a cold, if they are long term-allergies. The treatment of both would be the use of decongestants (topical or oral), oral antihistamines and cough suppressants if needed. I hope this helps",1,,

And i have geogrophical tongue. its still there. I dont know what could it be? when I go to doctor they tell me its an allergy.,"Hi! Geographical tongue is usually related to glossies, however, there are some instances that yeast overgrowth in the stomach can cause tonsils, pain in the submandibular lymph nodes/ pain and lymph adenopathy and later on will result to glossies. As we know that yeast can grow in an acidic environment and sugar-laden environment. However, there are several causes that the tongue may swell and that could be caused by allergens, nutritional deficiencies and/ or infections. If the swelling of your tongue/ glossies/ geographic tongue is caused by allergens then probably that is also the cause of your hives on the face. We need to treat the cause of your geographic tongue, if you think it is from yeast overgrowth in the stomach, then, a diet modification will do. Like avoiding acidic foods and beverages, avoiding cheese, nuts or those foods that is high in sugar and at the same time a probiotic Chat Doctor.  If you think it is caused by allergy then avoiding all the foods and allergens is the mainstay of prevention, and at the same time taking an antihistamine",1,,cheese

Welcome to Ask A Doctor.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  A side effect of Motrin(ibuprofen) is to cause stomach inflammation which can make the stomachs inside lining bleed. The blood is carried along with intestinal contents through the entire intestinal tract.  By the time it reaches the end it is black and makes stool black.  Blueberries, Pepto-Bismol, and iron supplements also make stool black.  A hive rash is an allergic rash and could be due to Motrin, especially if the hives appeared very soon after you gave him the dose.  Tylenol does not irritate the stomach and is safer.  Hard stool is usually due to not enough liquid intake.  You may want to try giving apple and pear juices.  If that doesn't help, prune juice, 1-2ounces one-two times per day might be beneficial.  Frequent colds and coughing could be from being in close contact with other young child Chat Doctor.  How old is your child?  Does he attend daycare?  Also, cold and cough syrups are NOT recommended to give to child",1,motrin,motrin

If you have allergy only during 3-4 four months time then you should start with antihistamine tablets. See for the results if there is no improvement then you have to go to the next step that is nasal steroid sprays. You have to start steroid nasal spray 3-4 weeks before your symptoms start. It gives very good results. If these sprays do not work then you have to undergo allergy test, an immunologist will do skin prick test to find out your allergic to what all substances.

In most cases it is viral, but bacterial infections can also occur. The pain and swelling in the face imply that the sinuses are infected. You can consider using antihistamines and decongestants which would relieve the nasal congestion and swelling in the face. Decongestants can be oral or topically applied. Since you are having a productive cough, you may want to consider using a bucolic which would help to break up the mucus in the chest.

I feel the redness and burning are causing more and more intense pain. I take Benadryl immediately after exposure. Is there anything else besides an epi pin I can use to decrease the pain level. The intensity of pain to the top layer of skin is very off the chart pains. Do I need to take a precaution ...often I do not know if food eaten or environment is the culprit. I firmly believe it is due to latex. I want to keep from anaphylaxis... what preventative measures do I need to have in place?","Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that you have allergies to more than one substance, and you do not exactly know what substances are acting as allergens for you. Thus, firstly, I would recommend you to go for a blood test for allergy. It will show in results what food and environmental substances are acting as allergen for you and so you can be alert in your day-to-day routine regarding exposure to these substances and avoid yourself from exposure. This is the best precaution you can take. In addition, you can also keep antihistamine such as Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) or Cetirizine 5 mg (Exocet) all the time with you so that as soon as the reaction starts, you can take the medicine immediately and control the reaction. Also, if you are allergic to more than one substance that you can be exposed to routinely, you can talk with your physician about taking an antihistamine regularly as hypertension patients take antihypertensives. Always take care to try new medicines and food items. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Take care. Best,",1,latex,
67,"The roof of my mouth is sore and swollen in some areas specially on the left side behind upper front teeth . I have a sinus allergy due to dust / weather because of which my nose remains perpetually closed and 80-90% of the time I am breathing through my mouth (consciously and unconsciously) including at night when sleeping This has caused multiple problems in the past, as esp. when weather is changing and my nose is worse, breathing from my mouth causes dry and parched lips , sore throat, and the sore/swollen mouth roof. However, the mouth roof problem is fairly recent, and this is only the second time it is happening now (earlier it was mostly sore throat followed by a flu/fever) The first time it happened, it went away in a couple of days as I applied oral gel.

I have taken Folic Acid as advised by some family/friends and also taking more water/milk and have applied oral gel before going to bed each night.

68,"Help! I have urticaria on my buttocks and thighs - humidity and tight pants might be a factor. I first noticed the red irregular bumps on my buttocks about 4 years ago in the summer after returning from the beach/ pool. I continued to get it every summer since after sunbathing; it lasts for 2 to 3 weeks and then it goes away. This year however, I got it in February (I was pregnant at the time) and its been coming back on and off in small bumps since then. I finally saw a dermatologist who did a biopsy; the diagnosis- papular urticaria. In hope for an answer, I saw an allergist as well - turns out im allergic to dust mites and cockroach (not known to cause hives). Yesterday I went to a hot yoga class; the room was warmer than usual and i sweated profusely. I got home and my right thigh was covered in red bumps of different sizes, some even expended into a massive red area overnight - they are somewhat itchy and my skin feels as sensitive as when I get sunburn. My left thigh is not as affected - just a few red bumps. I take Allegra on a regular basis and I used anti - itch lotion  for the first time today (Itch Fix,  i believe). I do not have any other medical condition aside from Thalassemia minor. The rash seems to have gotten worse since it first started 4 years ago, it really worries me. What else should i look into? What steps should i take?","Hello friend, I am a Homeopath and so my answer will be different from what you have already heard about allergy. Yes you are allergic to several things like heat of summer, dust, mites, cockroach etc. This hypersensitivity is inborn or genetic. But the time of developing hypersensitivity is related usually to a psychological conflict you had at the time of onset of the problem. If you started getting it 4 years back, exactly before that you must have had some shocking conflict which remain unresolved. But your brain associated the urticaria to the external environments like heat of sun, dust etc. instead of associating with the conflict. Now your brain has made a program associated with these factors and whenever you get exposed to such environments you get the symptoms of urticaria. First if you can recollect the conflict, then you can resolve it at the mental level. How you reacted to that is important because that is your genetic, constitutional individuality that made you to react in that manner. This will help the Homeopathic physician to select the constitutional remedy for you. Therefore, my advice to you is to approach an expert Homeopath at the earliest. You should stop taking any anti- Chat Doctor.  Once you are cured, then your urticaria will go away. With best wishes,",1,dust,dust

He started with itching on his forearm & top of hand about a week ago and then followed tiny bumps you couldn t see unless you really looked closely..Shortly after his chest,arms,legs,tops of feet,and hands were covered in what looks like a rash of some sort.. His hands are the worst.. He has tiny bumps that are filled with clear fluid and come in groups or single spots.. He says they do not hurt just feels really gross.. I have had scabies before and they look NOTHING like that.. We went to the ER today and the doctor told him it looks like a food allergy and prescribed him prednisone and atarex .. I m not sure he is happy with the diagnosis so I am trying to get a second opinion","Hello, It is not common to develop a food allergy at this age although not impossible. If the rashes he had developed were definitely after eating a specific food (which must happen every time) then a diagnosis of rash secondary to food allergy is plausible. What you describe is something like cholinergic urticaria, a form of urticaria (this is not allergy in >80% of cases) that is triggered by temperature changes and mast cell release of mediators like histamine. Scabies is also a possibility that is intensely itchy and needs to be excluded with a careful examination, skin scrapings or a course of treatment if there is high clinical suspicion. Atarax is a strong antihistamine (sedative, so take at night) and prednisolone must be stopped after 5 days giving Atari a chance to work. You can switch to non-sedative antihistamines like fexofenadine or cetirizine. There is no blood test for a definitive diagnosis but thyroid disease or diabetes need to be excluded along with a complete blood count to ensure there is no infectious trigger. Hope that helps.",1,,

Boil about 25 grams of Kabul and mango barks each in one liter of water. Allow a fomentation of these vapors directly onto the affected part of the skin. When the fomentation is done, dab the region with ghee. The itchiness will slowly disappear.b. Mix linseed oil in equal parts of lemon juice. Apply this on the region where itching is severe. This remedy works for treating almost all types of itching.c. Mix the juice of a fresh coconut and a tomato. Massage this on the itchy region. The itchiness will fade away.d. If the itchiness is spreading all over the body, then you may try out the following recipe. Mix some ground red gram (area I deal) in curds. Apply this on the skin for three to four days. The itching will stop spreading and will slowly disappear within a few days.e. Grind sandalwood and black pepper to a fine paste. Mix them in ghee. Apply them with a rough cloth onto the itchy skin.

Have already got an allergy shot but that only suppressed the sensation for a week.,"Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor The symptoms may be continuing because you are still being exposed to the allergen. You may need to consider allergy testing to determine what is causing your reaction so that it may eliminate. The use of decongestants- oral and topical (applied directly to the nose), may help relieve some of your symptoms. These would be available over the counter at your local pharmacy.

I understand your concern. Contrast dye used nowadays for various medical examinations is principally made of iodine.

100,i get a rash every summer on my inner elbow (only one are) on my belly and my back. it has been going on for a few years and nothing seems to relieve the itching. the doctors just told me i was allergic to something and to try changing different things but nothing seems to help and it only comes in the summer,"Hi and welcome to ChatDoctorFrom your history and description it does seem to be an allergy, esp based on the areas affected. Summer/spring allergies are fairly common due to more dust, pollen in the air, as well as sun. Since you are unable to narrow down the cause, I would advise you to take precautions during this season. Wear comfortable cotton clothing, covering as much skin as possible. Avoid midday sun exposure. Always use a sunscreen. Wash hands, face when you come back from outdoor activity. Shower with warm water and apply a good moisturizer immediately after like Detail DAM or an intensive moisturiser. Avoid fragrances and strong chemicals in soap, lotions. When you have active rashes try to avoid commonly allergy causing items like nuts, seafood etc.Also, during rashes take an antihistamine tablet once daily like fexofenadine and apply calamine lotion over the area when irritation occurs. In case of severe redness or actively spreading rash in the summer, use a fluticasone cream for about a week over the rashes and stop. Continue the other tips advised. You can consult a dermatologist regarding certain skin allergy tests and blood tests which can point out the substances you are allergic to. Hope this helps.",1,,"dust, pollen"
101,My eleven year old daughter has asthma and was on 20 mg of liquid steroid each day for five days/doses from 1/26-1/29. On 1/31 I took her back to the doctor and she repeated the steroids for a week but increased the dosage to 60mg/60mg/60mg/40mg/40mg/20mg/20mg and included two weeks of antibiotics. I m now concerned about her liver/kidney function and at this point I don t plan on going back to the prescribing doctor in reference to asthma issues. I read in Prescription for Nutritional Healing that wheezing can persist up to a month and my sister read that she was treated for acute asthma. How is acute asthma determined? Do you have an excellent referral to a asthma/allergy doctor who integrates immune support through appropriate supplementation? I am residing on Eastern Long Island and I don t mind traveling into the city.

Giving antihistamines alone without treating the actual cause would not work. If antihistamine has been administered properly and rash still persist, then allergy might be excluded. Other medications such as oral steroid can also get rid of allergic reactions when antihistamines alone fail.Also, possible are bacterial or viral infection of the palm skin most probably dermatitis. Local creams (antibiotics, antifungal or steroid etc.) could be administered to help deal with the affection. If rash persist, please do not hesitate to consult a dermatologist.",1,,

I scratched my arm quite a lot and pink/red dots appeared? I can also see small veins around the area. Little whitish bumps have also appeared. The skin is red and itchy. It s not dry, though. What s wrong? What do I do? It s been like this since yesterday. Thanks","Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. We call this Phenomenon as Triple response of Lewis. This is due to scratch on the skin. You had scratched the skin due to itching. In allergy, there is an increased release of a chemical called Histamine by Mast cells in our body. This histamine can cause itching, and thus you had scratched the skin. This scratching lead to erythema (redness) due to blood vessel dilation locally and increased permeability in blood vessels. These may look like red and pink dots. This is normal, and it can disappear in 30 to 40 minutes, once the histamine is broken down into inactive chemicals.However, in more than half of the peoples with high dose of allergens, this may persist and lead to late phase reaction up to 24 hours to 48 hours and then disappears.Thus, nothing to worry about, you can wait up to 48 hours. Please take antihistamines like cetirizine and mast cell stabilizers like montelukast. This will help in further release of anti-histamines from mast cells. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health.",1,,

You can get over egg allergy (at least 75%-80% do by age 5 years), but you retain the susceptibility of food allergy only to become allergic to a specific food later.

126,"Hi I am from Asia, male and of age 34. My wt is 68kg and ht is 1.65m, with no known health problems.My issue is my allergy reaction after drinking alcohol. I have rashes on my back, the rear of my arms, my torso and back of my neck. These rashes are small little red dots, and they are really painful when I sweat. Typically takes about a week before I get well. I came across articles on miliaria and after seeing pictures and reading of symptoms, sounds exactly like what I have! So question is if miliaria can indeed by triggered by consuming alcohol? And if indeed so, can I conclude I am actually not allergic to alcohol, but merely that my skin was unable to handle the heat involved with drinking, or that my pores are clogged? Id like to know that these rashes are limited to my skin and not a symptom of some bigger problems internal to the body. Lastly, please do advice if there is something I can do to prevent these rashes.. They are rally painful (like needles poking) when I sweat, which is really often here in hot and humid Singapore.Thanks for all your kind advice.Alex","Hi, This reactions is known as alcohol flush reaction. When we consume alcohol, it gets metabolized in body by liver enzymes into acetaldehyde and then into acetate. Alcohol causes vasodilation of small blood vessels and capillaries and sometimes bursts these capillaries under skin leaving behind broken capillaries and red spots. Also, alcohol causes diuresis by suppressing desmopressin release from kidney leading to extra work to the kidney and by this water comes out in bladder leading to depletion of water in body leaves skin Chat Doctor. This all is direct effect of alcohol in body when consumed in excess, you can consider it as an allergy.

It is very difficult to know the exact clinical picture without examination. Is the itching more at night? Are their any other family members affected?

Apply 5% permethrin cream after a scrub bath at night over the whole body except face, leave it overnight. Itching will persist or a few days even after you have applied the medicine properly.

A CT Paranasal sinuses will help in determining the extent of the sinus problem. Nasal steroid sprays with the correct technique (use) will help along with long acting antihistamines.

You could go ahead in using other Chat Doctor.  The concern or steroids causing immune depression to affect the inflammatory or immune response in this case, due to the Florist is out of question. The amount of steroid contained in it is too low to cause immune depression and real interactions have actually been described with associating with usually used antibiotics in managing this condition. You can appropriately use the spray at the time you have a cold. Colds are generally viral in origin, and for reasons mentioned above, no big interactions to interfere with efficacy or course of illness is actually present.

Post-operative itching of incisions is absolutely normal.  It is caused by the chemical histamine, which is present in healing wounds.  Some antibiotics cause itching if a patient is sensitive. In these cases, changing antibiotics usually takes care of the problem. It is usually a reaction to a post-operative medication.  Narcotics also cause histamine release and often an antihistamine helps or changing medication can help with the advice of your doctor. Ben Chat Doctor.  Don't scratch the area. Just mildly rub with soft cloth pad or ice to soothe. Washing with Menthol mixed water for immediate relief.

The condition that you describe is consistent with urticaria, and very itchy red hives that fade away but reappear within a few hours. Some attacks on the skin are raised and known as angioedema due to the chemical called histamine released from mast cells. These cells are present in the lips, tongue, skin, chest, gut etc. and therefore wherever histamine gets released, you get the specific organ related symptoms. Another condition called urticaria vasculitis definitely needs to be excluded and Moreno when there is no response to antihistamines.80% of people with urticaria do not have any allergies which is the case with you. Long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like fexofenadine 180\u00a0mg once daily plus/minus cetirizine 10\u00a0mg at lunchtime/evening is required for 3 months. Occasionally the treatment may need to be longer if there is a recurrence. Tests such as CBC, Lots, renal profile, TSH TPO abs are standard investigations to exclude a secondary cause. Most people go into remission so do not worry. Thanks.",1,,

Yes, I believe that both are possible scenarios. There may be specific proteins that are produced by the particular crab - not produced by the other crab - that act as allergens to you. And it may also be possible that there are also allergens inside the crab body that you are also reacting to. Whatever the case, what I would recommend is that you avoid the denseness or blue crab so that you will not trigger the allergic reaction again. Lastly, always be vigilant whenever you eat crab (or anything else) that triggers your allergies - some reactions may be mild, but a few can also be life-threatening so never hesitate to seek medical advice when this happens.

The first time we realised he had this was when he was 19 months . He was given medications like allegra , omnacortil . After 2 months of prolonged illness he was also given asthalin inhaler and budanase nasal spray since he was not getting any better . He has been experiecing the same symptoms since 6 weeks now . Allegra helps but temporarily . Can i start with the inhaler and nasalspray again ? Also what coudl be the side effects of these medications if continued for 2-3 months at a stretch ?","Hello, Your son has typical symptoms of allergic asthma and combination of bronchodilators (such as budesonide inhaler with spacer device), montelukast 4\u00a0mg, antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays (used for 6 weeks and stopped before restart after 3 months) is the standard management plan. As with all steroid usage, growth retardation is a recognized side effect but much lower than oral steroids as inhaled steroids are generally used to control airway inflammation along with montelukast. Skin prick testing is recommended to ensure common household allergens like cats and dog dander are not making the asthma worse when avoidance will be key. House dust mite allergy is also important to know as changing bedding or adding a layer of protection with dust-proof covers for mattress, pillows, duvets are important. Important to get rid of old soft toys as they accumulate dust very quickly. I hope that was useful.",1,,"cats, dust mite, dust"

Since you are pregnant, avoid any other medication and kindly do the following.1. Wash the area of bite with water and using mild antiseptic like Salon every day twice daily. This will prevent the bite area getting infected.2. Remove the sting carefully if it is still present at the bite site. 3. Apply ice packs to reduce swelling. 4. Take Tablet.

He will require oral antibiotics with antipyretic, antihistamines in syrup formulations. Now, if he has been diagnosed with asthma already then he would require bronchodilators like beta agonists and anticholinergics in MDI with spacer as child cannot synchronize himself. In addition, antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are also had a useful in the treatment of asthma but for all this treatment you must see pediatrician rather than giving him just self treatment.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I think you have food allergy related to non-veg diet and what we call \""solar urticaria\"". Talking about food allergy, it is very important to know your symptoms related to consumption of food. Usually they are immediate itching, rash, swelling after consumption of food. If it is so, I would suggest you to avoid the food you are allergic to for at least 6 months. Afterwards you can try to eat in small quantity to see whether you react. If you are not sure exactly to which non-veg food you are allergic to, I would suggest you to observe closely your diet and symptoms. Most common non-veg foods causing allergy are fish, shell fish, eggs, etc. Regarding sun allergy (solar urticaria), I would suggest you to take daily levocetirizine and montelukast for a month & use a good sunscreen lotion. Please protect your skin from direct exposure to sunlight. Vitamin A rich food like carrots, mango, green leafy vegetables will also help. Stress/tension can aggravate allergies, so I would recommend you daily relaxation and meditation. This will help you in a long run. Hope this will be useful to you. Wish you the best of the health.

Your allergy tests have come negative as well.  As you mentioned you have a family history of eczema and it's not necessary that the symptoms appear exactly similar to anyone else in the family.  You also mentioned that exposure to sun or heat makes it worse, it's an allergic reaction as your skin is very sensitive. You can use a sunscreen lotion with your dermatologists' advice for better protection. I would suggest you visit an immunologist/rheumatologist regarding this.  There might be a need for some blood tests to be done to see if the reason is autoimmune. Once its clear, treating the underlying cause will be easy and the symptoms will eventually go away.

Since the reaction was so severe, you may want to consider allergy testing by your doctor. This can be in the form of blood tests or skin tests. They can check for a large range of allergies.

Are others around presenting with same symptoms? Is it the first time you are experiencing this? Any fever or lymph node enlargement? A careful evaluation could really be needed. A food allergy is a possibility, but the spread is really unusual. It should be interesting to know the duration of time between consuming alcohol or pee nuts and developing the rash. If it occurred immediately after, it could be incriminated. But if not, other sources should be searched for. Characteristic lesion should easily guide the clinician, depending on whether the rashes are vesicles, pustules, males or pa pules and other clinical parameters, an appropriate diagnosis could easily be made.

Repeated episodes of wheezing is a symptom of asthma. Asthma refers to reversible obstruction of the air passages. There are different triggers that can cause an attack to occur.

If you continue to use it despite your allergy, the allergic response would progressively worsen. If you are accidentally exposed, then the use of oral anti histamines would help.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. Although there are so many types of rashes, I guess you may be having chronic urticaria. Chronic urticaria have so many causes. Common ones are physical ones - excessive sweating, exposure to warmth/cold, physical activity, sun exposure, pressure over some part of body, etc. If these are not the causes, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who may advise you some investigations like CBC, ESR, CRP, thyroid function, thyroid antibodies, urine & stool examination, allergy testing, etc. This will help him to reach at some diagnosis and suggest treatment accordingly. Till then, I would suggest you to take a Chat Doctor. Regarding blood sugar, it is very unusual for ALEX to cause elevation of blood sugar. This might be a chance finding. Please do not worry if your one time blood sugar report is high, I would suggest you to get fasting blood sugar, postprandial blood sugar & HbA1C reports which will help to know what is abnormal with your sugar levels and whether you are really diabetic or not.

The allergens like dust, food, pollen and mites will stimulate the mast cells to release histamine which is the marker of allergy and produces these weird symptoms of generalized hives. As your doctor has prescribed the antihistamines and the steroid which helps to control the symptoms but prolong use of celesta min should be discouraged as it has its own side effects. I would suggest you to identify the allergen causing these symptoms by undergoing skin prick test (SPT) and avoid exposing to these allergens. Otherwise, you can prefer immunotherapy either with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SUIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Thank you.",1,,"dust, pollen"

Then again suddenly he started to cough and cold. We found he has a wheeze and doctor said he must be allergic. He prescribed Levolin for 5 days 3 times a day He prescribed Montair for 2 weeks and Levolin. Are we using the correct set of medicines? Will it weaken him ? I am really worried about his being medicated so much. Thanks for the patience to read my question so long. Please help me.,"Thanks for your questionmonteleukast is a medication for allergy it acts by leukotreine blockade, so it can be taken and Levi albuterol is a short-acting beta 2 agonists which acts by dilation of the bronchus all these medications are safe as per symptoms but the point to be noted Is what exactly is causing such symptoms, is it allergy or something else you should consult a Pulmonologist who can request for an allergy test, serum IGE, or if possible or if age is more than 5 yrs your child can do a peer test to certain a diagnosis infection needs to be ruled outtake the above-mentioned medications as the dose prescribed to your child thanks feel free to ask more questions",1,,

330,Ive had a dry cough for 4 weeks along with dry and sore nasal lining. Throat is itchy and requires me to cough to remove the itch. No problem sleeping or any cold symptoms. CBC and diff all normal. Humidity at work is 22%. Had an ENT look at throat and nose lining and said it was perhaps a new allergy to something in my house. Cough occurs every 10 min or so during the day. Should I wait it out and just drink a lot of water or go see my family physician ?,"Hello, Runny nose, sneezing, nasal discharge (usually white), cough are signs of an allergic process. Once the rhinitis goes beyond control and affects the airways, you develop breathing difficulties as in asthma. That the CBC is normal, suggests the eosinophil count is also normal, that would exclude severe allergies. However, house dust mite or fungal allergies are common at this time of the year. I would suggest long-acting antihistamines like cetirizine 10\u00a0mg (maximum twice daily) and/or a nasal spray like Flonase 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 1 month and see the benefit. If things worsen after you stop, please get a blood test or skin prick test (must stop all antihistamines for at least 1 week if skin tests are required) to exclude allergic triggers. Hope this helps. Best Wishes.",1,,dust mite

The simple answer is no. Whether she might be allergic to some food or formula ingredient - I cannot say yes or no with confidence. You can try eliminating one food after another and see if the rash goes away. The only other way is a hi-tech method to check the blood for antibodies of the IGE class to different foods. I would not recommend this at present, but if the problem does not go away for, say, 2-3 months, you can approach her pediatrician for advice on allergy testing.

360,"i have itching, elevated bilirubin , dark urine, light stool, sweaty, short of breath but no jaundice . My glucose is normal, I have no allergies, no hives , no rash, no bites. I went to primary care and they gave me a prescription antihistamine, even though i was adament that i did not think this is an allergy. I am still itchy","Hello, Itching with elevated bilirubin may suggest that there is an obstruction in bile flow that most commonly occurs with gall bladder pathologies, and is usually gall stones. A detailed liver function test (LFT) would have helped to secure this diagnosis if the alkaline phosphatase was also raised. But as you mentioned no obvious jaundice, it is important to know that the other LFT parameters such as the enzymes are normal. An ultrasound liver/GB is important at this stage. Antihistamine will lower the itch but if this liver/GB related itch you will need medications like cholestyramine that should be prescribed after a visit/consultation with a gastroenterologist.

362,"Dear  Dr,  My daughter who is  10 yr old now has been suffering from  allergic rhinitis/Asthma/Wheezing for a long time.It all started when she was 5yrs old when she had running nose and cough in the night. Within 30 minutes of lying on bed she will coough and there will be intermittent cough. It got intensified. When we saw the doctor next day, he told us that it could be allergic rhinitis or asthma and would go away as the nasal passage becomes big/as she grows big  and several medicines were suggested. I dont remember them now but most of them were syrups. She also started to weeze  after running for awhile.After two yrs he suggested Montek LC one tab every day and  Levolin inhaler in case of chest tightness.  After this  she has been sleeping well, looked normal  and as per the doictors advice we started withdrawing Montek LC.  But in two days  all the symptoms are back.  In the middle of the night she gets up  and cough and her chest becomes tight & could not breathe. We had to give her 3 to 4 times Levolin inhaler some days. We are concerned if she had become dependent/addicted to Montek LC  and also to Levolin. Chest x ray is normal.  What is more troubling is that in the middle of night she gets up and and find it very difficult to breathe because of chest tightness.Please advice on  1  is it  OK to give Montek LC.

I can understand your concerns. You are having Urticaria and angioedema. Causative allergens can be food as well as non-food protein. You can undergo serum IGE level & absolute eosinophil count. You can take H\u2081 antihistamines non-sedating agents such as loratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine, or low-sedating agents such as cetirizine or levocetirizine. The addition of an H\u2082 antagonist such as sanitizing in conventional dosages may add benefit. A CysLT1 receptor antagonist such as montelukast, 10 mg/day also can be added. You have to continue for a longer period, as it may be seasonal. A short course of oral steroid (e.g. Deflazacort 6 mg daily orally for 7-10 days) helps in urticaria with eosinophil prominence, idiopathic angioedema with or without urticaria, or chronic urticaria that responds poorly to conventional treatment.",1,,

Why did this just occur when I moved and what besides these ineffective nose sprays can I use for relief?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The symptoms are suggesting me that you are having some allergic reaction which is causing all these symptoms. Nasal congestion and sinus clog are due to release of mediators of allergy like histamine which is responsible for your symptoms. As you have tested yourself with different allergen and found negative to allergens, I would suggest you to test for absolute eosinophil count to confirm the presence of allergic reaction in the body. For the present symptoms I would suggest you to take medicine like Tab Least, thrice daily for 5 days which will improve the conditions and makes you feel better. Thank you.",1,,
396,"hi i got stung by a wasp a couple of weeks ago,i went into anaphylactic shock i was taken to hospital and adrenline was given in my thigh.i was kept in for the afternoon.i currently dont have an epi pen.i went to the doc they wont give me one until i have had allergy testing done,the waiting list is 6 months.i am scared it will happen again what shall i do","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns.... As per your complaint it seems that you have an allergic reaction to the wasp sting that released toxin under your skin. You should consult an Allergist and get evaluated, and he can perform an allergic testing to rule out for allergic reaction, although it is kind of clear that you have allergic reaction, and he can start instilling an Immunotherapy so that in future if there are similar incidences of wasp sting the reaction will be less severe. You can also immediately take anti allergic like Allegra and steroid like Methylprednisolone to reduce the severity of allergic reaction. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

Asthmatics can use antihistamines especially since asthma is often associated with allergic conditions such as allergic sinusitis or allergic rhinitis.

Still you are feeling nausea, fatigue, running nose, difficulty in breathing. In my opinion all these symptoms are due to bronchoconstriction caused by some allergen.

Recently at first allergic skin prick test is done to detect suspected allergen, and subsequently it is confirmed by specific serum IGE assay. Though according to recent studies both these tests are equally effective. But there is no role of estimation of total serum IGE level.

423,"Hello, my wife who is pregnant 12 weeks tomorrow (First pregnancy and no health concerns) has developed a rash over the last 3 weeks.

It initially began as an oval shapped (almost scratch like) mark on the side of her upper body near the above the love handles and now has burst into a rash all over her abdomen, breasts and a few on the back. We have gone to a dertmatoligist and she has diagnosed Pityriasis Rosea. 2 Questions, I have done research online and only found 1 study showing that it increases the risk of miscarriage and may cause mobility issues or strength issues in the muscles as an infant that can be overcome. Are there any other more concrete studies showing the effects of this and what is your experience with this virus amongst pregnant women? The second question is what are the differences in symptoms of Pityriasis Rosea and PUPPP?","Hello there, thanks for your query. Your efforts in researching for scientific literature is commendable. As you have rightly found out there are not many studies regarding satyriasis rose in pregnancy. Those reports suggest possible miscarriage, premature delivery, movement issues in the baby. It is very difficult to Chat Doctor.  What one can do in such a circumstance is adopted a wait and watch policy and take adequate precautions to prevent miscarriage and preterm delivery. And undergo a detailed genetic sonogram (anomaly scan) to rule out structural defects in the baby.

It spares face, feet and palms. Whereas puppy is seen in the last trimester of pregnancy and seen as pa pules along lines of striae over abdomen and thighs, and it gets intensely itchy. It is most likely related to stretching of the skin. I would like to add that I have given gross features of PR, and it should not be used to diagnose the lesion by oneself.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. High eosinophil counts and symptoms during temperature/weather changes highly favor allergic rhinitis. I would suggest you to take daily montelukast and levocetirizine at least for 2 weeks. If your problem is long-standing (over a few years), a course of intranasal corticosteroids will help better. However, if you always have one-sided symptoms, you could have simultaneous local nasal problem also (allergy usually causes both-sided symptoms), so I would suggest you to consult an ENT surgeon who will examine you and may identify a local cause. Correction of the cause of nasal blockade will improve your snoring also. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,,

As your doctor has prescribed medicine for the symptoms of allergy you can take these medicines. These medicines will control the symptoms, but it is not going to cure your condition, you have to find out the reasons for your symptoms. You need to test your blood sample for absolute eosinophil count, it will help to know the presence of allergic reactions in the body. To avoid the symptoms of asthma, you should not be exposed to the triggering factors which may be a dust, pollen or food. The allergen causing these symptoms should be avoided as for as possible. If it is not possible to avoid the allergen you can consider taking of immunotherapy by consulting your doctor. For the present symptoms, you can take the medicines prescribed by your doctor.

You can also take some antifungal medicine like tab role 150 mg once daily in night for at-least 5 days. In addition to all you have to use clobit-gm or valnerate-c cream for local application.

As you have mentioned your complaints are basically hypersensitive and autoimmune by nature. this kind of problems are caused by altered sensitivity and susceptibility to the environment (may in external or internal). Being a homeopath what I can say is that homeopathy is most probably more suitable to treat such condition as it treats the person, and not the disease. As you have taken Homeopathy in past there may be 2 things, 1) As psoriasis is being known for its recurrence, it may have come back but this time in less intensity and in less area of your body. 2) your homeopath needs to rework on your case, make fresh case taking and see how things unfold.

There are different causes but based on the fact that your symptoms occur with certain positions then it may be caused by BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). This is a condition of the inner ear, and it is not related to your allergies. Your doctor can confirm this by performing certain maneuvers in his or her office. Treatment would involve your doctor taking you through other maneuvers (called EPLE maneuver) to correct the issues in the inner ear causing the problem. I hope this helps",1,,
459,"My husband began taking blood pressure meds (amlodipine and benzepril) and antidepressants (Celexa) about 5 yrs ago (age 40). He has over that same time developed allergic reactions to vinegar, garlic, rosemary, and tree nuts. If he even touches these things he has trouble breathing and develops itching or hives. He even found he couldnt do wood working with walnut wood. Allergy testing does not show immune system response, so these are anaphylactoid not anaphylactic. This has gotten to be very debilitating as standard allergy meds knock him out for 16-20 hrs. So he cant work. Could the medications be causing the sensitization?","Many academicians have analyzed your type of questions and have generated a lot of information whether this causes allergy. Analyses have not fetched the cure because of diverse opinions and failure to find a solid approach. Only Ayurveda has the answer by orally taking safe herbals over some months or even more than a year and find enhanced immunity to prevent such allergens from making a reaction in your body. But it's not less than a feat to gulp pure herbals being unpalatable in taste, coarse looking and reminding of pre-historic era. Who cares about scientific sanctity of such herbs. Though, of late people are switching to Ayurveda successfully to find an answer. There are companies like Himalaya and others who contributed a lot to translate findings in modern terms.

I dont have allergies. I also dont have any cold/flu symptoms time period of sneezing.I got tested for allergy they siad nothing i am living in california in san jose","Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor. As allergy has already ruled out, other possible causes are sinus problem or vasomotor rhinitis. Consult ENT doctor for examination, Nasal endoscopy is useful to check for sinus, once sinus problem is ruled out, other probable cause is vasomotor rhinitis, which is basically due to dilatation of blood vessel in nose causing symptoms. Saline nasal spray, decongestants are useful, If your symptoms are not controlled with these measures then corticosteroid nasal sprays, antihistamine nasal sprays useful. Correction of any deviated septum, if present, is helpful in avoiding recurrence. If you are able to identify what causes your symptoms it may be possible to avoid these triggers, such as perfumes, secondhand smoke, dust, etc. Avoiding these triggers will reduce your symptoms and discomfort. You should also avoid overusing nasal decongestants. Hope this helps you. Regards",1,,dust

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your wives history. I would like to know more about her symptoms like - What are her symptoms while she consumes milk? Since what age she started having allergy reactions? What is the frequency of these reactions? Does she have any other medical problem? Does she take any regular/frequent Chat Doctor?  Were I treating her, I would suggest her Specific IGE by Immunogen for milk protein or skin prick testing or preferably both for milk allergy. If it is positive, I would suggest her to restrict milk & milk products for at least 6 months. If it is negative, there are high chances she has milk intolerance rather than milk allergy, which is an entirely different condition.2. Not all hives/swelling of body parts are always due to allergies, especially if they are present for more than several months and no clue can be thought of about precipitating factor. In such cases, I usually advise tests like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, ANA, tests for liver, kidney & thyroid function, allergy testing, urine & stool examination, etc. Selection from these tests can only be done after reviewing complete history of the patient. I would also suggest her testing for physical urticaria which is performed by allergists/dermatologists. With these tests, usually diagnosis can be made in 60-70% of the cases, but not in all the cases. Hope above answer will be helpful to you.

This condition is relatively rare because the skin of the scalp tends be thicker than in any other place on the body. Simply avoiding the irritant may be enough for some, while others might require further treatment. Mild cases can be relieved with calamine lotion, which will help soothe the area and relieve itching. Moderate cases may require a prescription for a steroid cream. For serious reaction with oozing and crusting, a wet or damp cloth can be applied directly to the area for immediate relief. If the symptoms are not relived you may have to consult your dermatologist. Thank you.",1,,

However, it would be good to rule out causes of itches especially given the fact that this particular itches as you said have been a problem since a month now and at night. Accumulation of certain substances in the body due to their not being able to be excreted can also cause such itches. This is common when the gall bladder which uses bile to excrete toxins from the body has some issues. So kindly see a physician for lab test especially for the gall bladder to rule out other causes other than allergies. Check to see if something AHS changed too in your diet or bed or what you use to ensure It's not simply some allergy. However, it would be good to see a physician to rule out some other cause such as gall bladder malfunction. Hope this helps. Quick recovery and regards, Chat Doctor.",1,dust,

I would suggest you to keep a note of each and every food your daughter consumes with time and date and also note the time and date of symptoms. Please note ingredients of each food items too. Your keen observation will help you to identify the food causing allergic symptoms. I would like to let you know that most common foods causing allergy are - milk, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, shellfish, fish & meat. However, it is possible to have allergy for any of the foods, so food diary is indeed a handy tool. Rast tests are used for diagnosis of food allergy, but they are not 100%. It is possible to have a negative Last test despite having allergy to food and also vice versa. Also, sometimes a child can have non-allergic reaction to a food, which cannot be picked up in laboratory tests. If this approach does not lead you to any conclusion, I would suggest you to consult an allergist-immunologist, who will ask you in very much detail and may suggest you some investigations. He may also advise you to keep a food diary. Hope this will help you. Wish your daughter the best of the health. Regards.",1,nut,"peanut, eggs, shellfish, fish"

It appeared after I had a nap on their fold out bed. Although I dont seem to have any allergies I do often have itchy eyes, a runny nose and sneezing when I sleep there. Now I dont have any of those symptoms but I do have the rash which itches intensely and it seems to be getting worse. It now looks like I have mosquito bites all up the inside of my arms, around my armpits and up the sides of my torso. My back is also itchy as well as my tummy and under my breasts but there are not as many visible spots. Does this sound like an allergic reaction or could it be something contagagious? Should I go to the doctor since I have had this for 6 days? Besides the itching I am not really affected. Thank you","Hello, Thank you for writing to us. House dust mite allergy is a likely possibility given the itchy eyes, runny nose and sneezing. Urticaria can happen (itchy hives) sometimes due to the dust allergy but usually unrelated. You will need skin prick tests or specific IGE blood test to find out what your allergies are (aeroallergen panel). Long acting antihistamines like cetirizine 10\u00a0mg or fexofenadine 180\u00a0mg plus Flonase nasal spray 2 spray/nostril twice daily is recommended for severe house dust mite allergy. You will need to take both for at least 2 months to have a good effect. The antihistamines will also work for the urticaria. I hope that was useful. Best Wishes.",1,mosquito,"dust mite, dust"

Your hives may or may not be related to your alcohol intake (especially if it occurs right after Chat Doctor.  If it is generalized and associated with itchiness, this may be due to elevated bilirubin levels which means that there is an increase in deposit of bile salts in your skin, hence, the itchiness all over the body. In cases of elevated bilirubin levels, further investigation of the hepaticopancreaticobiliary tree are must be done for etiology. It may be infective or obstructive (secondary to stones or tumor lesions) in origin. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a gastroenterologist or a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation.

Usually rare as something usually triggers the reaction. A dermatologist will have to look at the skin lesions and determine the type of affection you are presenting. Hope this helps",1,,

Previous Doctors have thought my fainting spells were caused my anaphylactic allergic reactions but recently another doctor claimed I have vasodepressor syncope and the hives are caused from over-heating (which I often get hives from).  I was wondering If you also thought I should see a cardiologist or should continue on new allergy medications.","Howell come to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, apart from the allergic condition if this is pure syncope then this could be due to cardio vascular disease or central nervous system related disease and these both possibilities need to be ruled out, if this turned unremarkable then one can think about the allergy, but syncope is very uncommon in your case, with eruption of haves hysteric attack may be likely, hope this information helps.",1,"shellfish, penicillin",

That he woke up with the hives would suggest a spontaneous episode, but ensure he had not taken any meds the night before. Long acting antihistamines like Fexofenadine 180\u00a0mg and/or Cetirizine 10\u00a0mg will be required for 2 weeks to ensure a complete resolution. If this recurs, do get allergy testing if there is a clear trigger or thyroid function tests. Best Wishes.",1,,

555,"Hello Doc, I have some questions for you. I experienced rapid heart beat last night after I ate fried fish and red spots occurred all over my body and I felt like my head was so hot that it seems like its going to burst. Everything went back to normal after I drink soft drinks (sprite). My parents gave me anti-allergy medicine but I was afraid to take it because It might make it worst. I also experienced this last week, after eating dried fish. I am 22 years old now, and when i was in Grade 5, i had an asthma attack. I cannot breath air and was taken in ICU after I ate Tuna Fish. Only those times I have those kind of reactions but most of the time nothing happens if i eat any kind of fish. Do you think I am allergy to fish, doc? What kind of allergy is it? If it will happen again next time, will it be a threat to my life?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. As you are not experiencing symptoms every time you eat fish, first I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather than fish allergy. Histamine fish poisoning is a relatively common type of food poisoning. It occurs after consumption of improperly preserved or inadequately refrigerated fish (Fish require stringent refrigeration for preservation). It occurs due to presence of excess of a substance called histamine in the fish. The symptoms are the ones you described - skin rash, itching, headache, palpitation, sometimes breathlessness, etc. The symptoms develop within a few minutes of consumption of fish and usually subside by 6, rarely last up to 12 hours. A very important thing to know is that it is not possible to know whether the fish is likely to cause histamine poisoning by look or even taste of the fish. It looks and tastes same. Only sometimes one feels a typical peppery or burning taste in mouth while consuming fish, one can suspect it is rich in histamine and one should not consume it. Usually antihistamines medications like chlorpheniramine and sanitizing are used for treatment of symptoms. So, in your case, I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather fish allergy. It is even more common wish some variety of fish like Tuna, Sardine, Mahi-mahi, etc. It is not an allergy. Furthermore, it is usually benign and self-limited, but rarely it can cause death. If you experience any serious symptom like difficulty in breathing, dizziness, palpitation, etc. it is advisable to go to ER and get examined by physician and treated. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,fish,fish

Your history does seem to resemble that of allergic rhinitis which is common in child Chat Doctor. I assume your pediatrician has ruled out any infection and completed a course of antibiotics to treat if any. Singulair is an appropriate prescription if the cause is confirmed to be allergy. The mouth breathing is definitely due to nasal blockage and congestion whicChatDoctormonly occurs due to infection or allergy or an ENT problem like tonsils adenoids hypertrophy or deviated nasal septum. A complete Ear nose throat examination, chest auscultation and blood tests like complete blood counts and blood smear and erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) can mostly differentiate between them and give an exact diagnosis.

For how long you're suffering from it? Any other associated problem? Like diabetes ? Any fever? Any history of heart problems? Any liver problem? Any medications apart from hypertension ones?  Which medicine you're taking for hypertension right now? And for how long you're taking it? What is your BP reading?  Longstanding uncontrolled hypertension ultimately does cause damage to small arteries leading to antipathies which may give you these symptoms and it is also associated with naturopathies too, but again it should be diagnosed after careful evaluation by a physician.  Another probability is that you might be having some vasculitis which is giving you these symptoms. If I am your attending physician, I will go for FBC, ESR , LIPID PROFILE along with the DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF BOTH UPPER and LOWER LIMBS to rule out any arterial insufficiency.  If you are really concerned do meet your doctor, he may also get your X-ray of both hand and feet too.  Meanwhile stay calm and continue with your hypertension medications. You can use TAB NEUROSES daily along with tab AMELIA 25 mg at night. It will help you relieve symptoms. And do meet your doctor get well soon Hope your query is adequately ad Chat Doctor.",1,,

I think you are suffering from allergic rhino-sinusitis. I think for sinusitis you are suffering from heavy head. Please go for an x-ray para-nasal sinuses to exclude chronic sinusitis and polypoid sinus diseases. If anything found on x-ray, a CT scan of para-nasal sinuses may be done to properly evaluate it. If any polypoid changes occur in the sinuses then FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) can be done to remove it permanently. Otherwise, you should continue to take telecast L, NASA but not Topped 200 for prolonged period.  In addition to that you may consult an allergist and may go for skin prick test and specific IGE tests to detect specific allergen and immunotherapy to that allergen so that you can be protected from that allergen. I also advise you to go for a spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and management of it properly.

Urticaria is a condition when mast cells in the skin release histamine after simple triggers such as scratching (physical), but also to temperature change (such as hot shower or cold-induced urticaria), stress, infections etc. Foods high in salicylates can also trigger and the foods you mention do fall in that category. Long-acting antihistamines such as Allegra 180\u00a0mg once daily for 3 months should be tried to see the effect. Removing foods high in salicylates as a trial for a maximum period of 4 weeks is recommended, but no longer if there has no obvious effect.

For allergic bronchitis you may ask your doctor to add long acting bronchodilator nebulization like Foretell or Albuterol which may prevent recurrent episodes of wheezing, oral antihistamines, montelukast and bucolic combinations which prevent allergic response and helps in clearing chest of secretions. Episodes of cough, wheezing, chest congestion occur due to exposure to an allergen. You will need to identify what is triggering such episodes. It may be allergens like pollen, dust, mite etc., Sometimes chemicals like perfumes, mosquito repellents etc. Adequate treatment may not be as effective if exposure to allergens is continued. Also since your son is having this problem since two years it would be better if you consult pediatric pulmonologist for further evaluation.",1,,"pollen, dust, mosquito"
581,Im sneezing every morning and then sometimes I have sneeze attacks that just comes on suddenly. What could this be? I have had surgery already so the sinus would drain but I still have the sneezing. I have also got tested for allergys but thier was none.,"Hello there, Thank you for the question. The sneezing that you are describing seems allergic only. Many allergies do not show up on the allergy panel. Moreover, the thing that you are allergic to can be different from what you were tested with. So try to find what it is that you are using like bedsheets, or pillow covers, curtains, or room fresheners. It could be anything. If I were to treat you I would use Allegra 180 mg once a day for a few days as this will reduce your symptoms and allergic reaction. Hope this helps. Take care.",1,,

Since its Parkinson, and she is already seen by a neurologist who has advised to take syn dopa. It is a symptomatic way of dealing. Since you mentioned the rigidity she has is not lowering down, why don't you take a discussion with a neurologist and take some guidance of having physical therapy for your mother.

The only relief i had was towards the end of the diflucan treatment for about a week then it gradually came back.  I have tried allergy pill and switched laundry detergent, shampoo, and body soap.  I have tried otc eczema cream and every type and fabric of underwear known to man.  What seems to offer the most relief is jock itch powder or baby powder.  I have faith in my doctor that i have been to the last four times now but he is talking about doing biopsy and want to make sure that is the way to go before cutting on my family jewels.  I have not been to dermatologist as I live in a smaller town and would have to be referred and drive quite a ways to get there and am kind of worried he will just try all of the same things.  Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am kind of miserable at times especially while driving.",Thanks for contacting ChatDoctorI am sorry to hear that you are having problems with a rash in your genital area. From your description it does sound like you have a fungal problem. I would recommend that before doing a biopsy that your doctor perform a fungal and bacterial culture of the area. The cultures may find that you have a fungus that is resistant to the antifungals. It may also show a bacterial infection that maybe masking or symptoms. This test would not require any incisions or cutting into the family jewels. I also recommend continuing the anti jock itch powder. Wearing open and loose fitting underwear. It is also possible you may have an allergy to your detergent or fabric softener and I recommend changing them and see what happens Hope this answers your question. Please contact us again with your health care concerns and questions,1,,

I find that the normal allergy medication dosen t work, the only thing that seems to work is Advil , so I m taking Advil on a daily basis and don t really like that idea. I did get checked for allergies but nothing major showed up. Could you suggest what I could do or take to help me stop sneezing continously please.","Hi, Sneezing could possibly be due to an allergen for sure. Its possible you could be getting relief from Advil. However, Advil is Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.

But as your doctor as examined and informed you that the increased blood pressure is not because of the symptoms. There are many modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors which can play a role in pathogenesis of hypertension. High blood pressure requires both lifestyle modification and medicines. I would suggest you to check BP regularly, if it is high consult a physician and take proper treatment. Thank you.",1,,

643,My daughter was treated with hives last night having had a shot of predizilone and benadryl. She returned home no problem and slept great. At about 5 a.m. she woke up very irate saying she was itchy and we discovered that the skin reacting had returned and it was all over the body. What should I do to ensure that this rash does not return or should we keep treating it with benadryl? Should we take her back to urgent care for an allergy test?,"Hello. Welcome to ChatDoctorYour daughter seems to have developed an allergic reaction to something which she came in contact with at night. Was this the first such reaction or has she had similar allergies in the past? It is important to find out what caused the allergy, as re-exposure to it will cause the hives and itching again. Was there any contact with dust, pollen, outdoor plants, insects, pets, any possible bed bugs, mites, or new medication? Any history of eating out, especially seafood, nuts, etc? Did anyone else experience similar symptoms? The Ben Chat Doctor.  Prednisolone may be needed if there is a severe outbreak of rashes. In case of severe symptoms like breathlessness, puffiness of face, lips, go to the ER immediately. Apply calamine lotion over the itchy skin. These are just temporary symptomatic treatments. To prevent further attacks, the trigger cause needs to be found. If this often happens, keep a note of any possible factors, as I mentioned, that could be the trigger each time. Antihistamine needs to be continued till the symptoms subside completely, maybe 3-5 days. Visit the dermatologist if they are persistent even on treatment. Your doctor may suggest blood tests if needed. Skin tests for allergy are generally not done during an active episode of hives. A later date may be given to you. You may be referred to an allergy specialist. For now, continue treatment as advised and observe. Hope this helps.",1,,"dust, pollen, insects"

Please help","Hi, I had gone through your question and do understand that your daughter is suffering from Urticaria. The exact cause for this is not clear as it can result due to food allergy, medicine allergy, changes in local weather, etc. Hence, considering the vaccination to be the cause of this condition can be ruled out. To have a cure for this condition I would like to suggest the following Ayurvedic medications for 15 days which I usually give to patients who come to my clinic.1. Tablet Laghusutashekara NASA - 1 tablet twice daily before food with warm diluted milk.2. Hard Chat Doctor.  3.

The condition you have referred to is called Urticaria or hives. It's an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IGE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids.

I cant stop itching. am I allergic to all foods... ??? please someone help me..","Hello Lisa, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. There are two types of allergy tests - skin prick test (which you have been undergone) and serum tests (Immunogen or LAST). I suggest you not to be worried by test results. These tests are not 100%. They only complement a clinicians decision about diagnosis of your food allergy. If you are demographic, skin testing will give you what we call false positives (means even if test is positive you are not allergic to it). So in a demographic person, skin testing is not a reliable test. So forget the results of skin test if you are demographic!! Diagnosis of food allergy requires a very detailed history about your symptoms & your diet, right from very beginning when you had your first allergy symptoms. This requires a detailed consultation. After suspecting the foods you may be allergic to, you may be advised serum allergy tests to support the diagnosis. The best diagnosis of food allergy is by food challenge which is done at specialized allergy centers. I would suggest you to keep a food diary in which you can keep note of food taken (including ingredients) and every symptom you developed, with time & date. This will help you and your doctor to suspect what is it that may be causing symptoms. Common food allergies are milk, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, fish & shellfish. But one can be allergic to any other food substances from routine diet. Also, I should tell you that there are other gastrointestinal disorders which may mimic food allergy and there is food intolerance (in simple words it means one cannot tolerate some foods) also. A gastroenterologist consultation would be helpful to you if you don't have food allergy. So I would suggest you not to think that you are allergic to all foods! Also, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine (levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine) and montelukast daily to control your symptoms. Wish you best of the health. Regards.",1,,"wheat, peanut, eggs, fish, shellfish"

These medicines also require steroids to be given. Many patients experience lowered immunity as a result of these medicines and subsequently might have inflammation and infection. It is possible that you have developed inflammatory sinusitis and this can be treated symptomatically with over the counter decongestants. However since you have the symptoms for 3 months therefore please get a clinical opinion from the ENT specialist and confirm any infection due to your lowered immunity which might require treatment.

Can she really be allergic to the knee replacement ? Besides going through the second surgery what should she do?,To know the cause for this you need to do different allergy test. I Don't think that she will have allergy with the transplant knee. Because the material which is used for knee use to be a different special non-allergic material. But to have conformation you can visit your or tho and check with the material he has kept and do an allergy test with it. Now at present she can take symptomatic treatment and I suggest ask her to do regular walking or cycling exercises. Because doing regular exercises also helps for reducing inflammation in body. Also check with the hematologist and dermatologist for further use of medication as well to check other causes of this. And if there is anything which can be done to identify the kind of allergy apart from allergy test. Here I told that it can not be total knee replacement as a cause of this because after replacement she was fine for more than 6 months if there is something related to it than it will start immediate after replacement with in a week time.

I have developed a cough that resonates very deeply in my chest, and, when I lie down, I can hear all sorts of gurgling and wheezing sounds.  I got myself kind of worked up last night, I think, and also had very sharp pains across my chest that did not feel like reflux or indigestion, but certainly could have been.

Treatment of multi trigger wheeze is similar to asthma and include salbutamole/levosalbutamole to control symptoms and inhaled steroid to prevent episodes. Inhaled steroid is safe and usually have only local side effect like oral thrush which can be prevented if child do gargle after each puff. this medicine is necessary otherwise child may have recurrent episode Your doctor is treating in right direction, so I suggest you to follow his all direction and don't leave medicine without his advice.

709,"My 8 month old has had a runny nose (clear mucous) and watery eyes (no redness) for the last three days. She doesn t appear to be fussy or uncomfortable. I do hear the congestion in her nose when she is breathing. Does this sound like a cold, or an allergy?","Hello, This sounds like a reaction to pollen and changing weather. But in general, we don't consider babies to have true seasonal allergies until they are a bit older. You have to live through a few seasons of pollen before you can have a true immune allergy response. But, pollen is an irritating molecule and babies little noses and little eyes can get irritated and make mucous just upon exposure to varying levels of pollen (or dust, or animal dander, smoke). If there is no fever or cough then she probably doesn't have a cold. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.",1,,"pollen, dust"

735,"Hello sir/mam,My daughter is 3 years old.She was getting allergy Related wheezing once in 2 weeks.But now she has continous wheezing for past 1 week and doctor advised to go for an x-ray.X-ray report says Bilateral mild vascular congestion. Blood report says eosinophil is 540 Wbc 10800.Doctor said its pneumonia and advised for antibiotics through IVE. Since we requested an alternative method he is giving taxim injections  twice a day.My concern is so far we have given 5 injections  but our doctor says he will decide by tomorrow whether to withdraw injections and give syrups..We are concerned whether we can give so many injections for 3 year old....moreover she has lost weight also.....please advise Thank you Swetha","Hello Mam, I just read your query. As you have mentioned pneumonia and your physician has started antibiotic I/V treatment. Antibiotic treatment always has a schedule whether it is given orally or through I/V line. *So as per your question antibiotic through I/V line can be given to three years old as per diseases status and your treating doctor can decide it better because he is doing regular clinical examination.* The loss of weight might be due to improper feeding because during sickness babies have tendency to refuse diet, and they take less amount of food compare to normal.* So complete the treatment and try to give baby more semi-solid and liquid diet as it is easy to give and digest.* I hope you find my answer helpful.

There are many physical causes like excessive sweating, hot/cold water bath, sun exposure, etc. So personally I would suggest investigations like CBC, ESR, CRP, urine and stool examination.

Although this is called black eye, color can vary depending on age and depth of blood collection. Superficial bleeds will initially appear red and later change to blue and the black. If there are no complaints of severe headache or vomiting, you need not worry-just apply ice pack and give paracetamol for minor pain.

Or is this the first time you have taken Bactrim? Also, if this is the first time, did the assumed allergic reaction occur immediately after the first dose or after a few doses, and which dose caused this? Which infection have you been diagnosed to have? The reason why I ask these questions is because, the rash could very well be related to the infection that you are currently being treated for. This will have to be ascertained by your treating doctor, so please do consult him/her for the same. The next thing is, if this is indeed an allergic reaction to Bactrim, you will have to immediately discontinue this medication. For this as well, you will have to report to your doctor, who will confirm the cause, discontinue the current medication and initiate a substitute. In the meantime, avoid any irritation to the area of the rash, wear comfortable clothing, avoid scratching the region, and avoid application of any prescribed medication on the region of the rash.Also, please Chat Doctor.  I am unsure about your infection or other medications, so I cannot comment on other effects you have been suffering. The best thing right now would be to visit your treating doctor.

Car exhaust, garages, musty leaves or crawl spaces, cleaning agents, bleach, fabric softener, perfumes, sometimes a dog that has a skin treatment. Doctor recommended an antihistamine. I took one, one day last week, then a few hours later went to an enclosed swimming pool. Within 5-10 minutes, my throat swelled and my throat was covered in little white bumps. Doctor is on vacation. We talked about an allergist. I was checking out allergic reactions on this site and nothing seemed to fit my symptoms.","Hello, You might be having hypersensitivity. You need to get complete blood count done to see if there is eosinophilic in blood. In people with allergy generally there will be eosinophilic. In that case, you need to take a course of Genocide Forte or Betrayal tablet 3 times a day for 2 weeks. This will bring down allergic reactions. Kindly discuss this with your doctor. Till then just avoid whatever things that is causing you allergy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",1,,

I didnt seem to have an allergic reaction at time of sting, perhaps having a delayed reaction?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and from your history I would first think of delayed local reaction to bee sting. I would suggest you cold compresses and antihistamines like cetirizine of levocetirizine. This will control itching. You can take analgesics if it is painful. However, if it grows in size, gets pus inside, causes you to have fever or any other systemic symptoms, I would suggest you to consult a physician. Hope this will be helpful to you.

Yes u had pointed correctly it can be allergy to relining material. Reliner contains monomer which causes sore throat and burning sensation. And it will take approx 7-15days to completely heal. If a cold refiner was used and u gets the same symptom again on wearing denture after 7 days then it is allergy to other contents of the relining material. And that refiner needs to be replaced. Meanwhile u can use analgesic, anesthetic mouthwash for relief...and take some antiallergics. A denture is usually made of acrylic. Heat cure mostly and u were using denture earlier so you are not allergic to heat cure acrylic/ acrylic itself. U can get a new denture fabricated or ask your dentist for relining by heat cure acrylic. Remember in cold cure relining material unused monomers causes adverse chemical reaction on mucosa sometimes. So u should always avoid this type of relining or rebasing in the future.",1,,

807,"I am 59, and recently had surgery to remove a very large lipoma from my back. The surgery was done in an operating room due to the large size of the lipoma. I have a severe allergy to latex - type 1 IgE mediated with anaphylaxis, and strict latex precautions were in place. I also have severe asthma secondary to the latex allergy. I do have diabetes - type 2 insulin dependant, and I am post graves disease. I was intebated. When I was extabated, I had trouble breathing. The Anesth gave me an updraft of epinepherine, and I turned blue, and my O2 sat dropped to 70%. The epi was stoped and I recovered, but had severe chest pain. I was admitted and had the chest pain again the following morning. Evidently I showed an atypical rise in my Troponin T levels, with a negative CKMB. I also had some EKG changes. I was transferred to the large medical center, and was evaluated quite extensively - all was negative (stress echo, nuclear stress, )no angiogram was done. I was on a nitro drip and also on heparin IV. Nothing showed except this elevated troponin t level, and they discharged me without a real diagnosis after 24 hours. What do you think happened to me? Could it be related to my latex allergy? ? histamine release?? My tryptase level was 18.5 Could I be allergic to epinepherine? I also showed some fluid around the heart - ? why?","Hi, Troponin level could be raised because of lots of conditions including severe anaphylaxis, post-surgery apart from cardiac disease.  But an ECG change along with raised Troponin level is highly suspicious of cardiac disease (blockage in arteries of the heart) and also you had the chest pain. Plus you are a Diabetic. I could not think of anything other than a cardiac-related problem. We do not recommend doing a stress echo in patients with positive Troponin, dynamic ECG change and with chest pain.

No signs of anaphylaxis (no nausea, faintness, trouble breathing) so I m wondering how serious and what s going on?","Hi. Can understand your concern... As per your complaint swelling on hand and rash are due to allergic reaction of the venom left by the sting of the insect leading to inflammation and swelling, increased temperature of the localized inflamed area are signs of inflammation.

In case if you do not have any systemic symptoms you need not worry but even a little sign of anaphylaxis should be taken seriously, and Emergency room should be consulted. For localized allergy Antihistamines like Clarity or Ben Chat Doctor. . For relief from pain OTC painkiller like Ibuprofen can be taken. Apply ice packs over the inflamed area.

It is possible that your response is related to the use of the chlorohexidine if there have been no other changes. You can try to eliminate it for a few days to see if the reaction ceases. If it continues then it isl likely that the reaction in not related and there is another source. Allergy testing can help to identify the cause. This can be done by skin prick testing or blood tests.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. One most important thing I would like to know is whether you itch without hives/skin lesions/urticaria or with them. If you have hives/urticaria, I would say you are having chronic urticaria. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will perform some tests for physical urticaria and suggest some blood tests like total blood count, ESR, serum anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies and urine & stool examination. Some of these tests are for autoimmune disorders. Then he can treat accordingly. But if you are not having skin lesions at all and only itching, I would not think of allergy at first. The causes are many like Chat Doctor.  So I would suggest you to consult a physician who may suggest you tests like CBC, ESR, blood sugar, SEPT, total proteins including albumin & globulin, urea, creatinine and urine & stool routine and microscopic examination. Then he can treat you accordingly. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,,

I get affected easily from Bangalore climate - sneezing , nosing, nose & eye irritation etc particularly in mornings. My age is 65. I do 1 Hr walking in the morning and take controlled food. Otherwise I m fit and am still working in an Engg Firm. Advise me ways to control this allergic deficiency and to reduce eosnophlia count. YYYY@YYYY 0000 Bangalore","Hello, Reading your query and the results of the blood tests, I presume that the percentage of eosinophil count is 10% that has several causes. The commonest cause in tropical countries is parasite infections, and antiparasitic treatment is recommended after stool culture studies. This is a must before going through unnecessary tests or treatments. If the eosinophil count remains high and sneezing and rhinoconjuncitivitis symptoms persist, it would suggest allergies as the underlying cause. Pollen allergy, smoke (industrial) are major factors that need high dose antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. The duration of treatment will depend on the trigger (i.e., seasonal vs perennial [all year around]). There are several other causes but infections, allergies and rarely autoimmune diseases are causes of raised eosinophil counts. I also hope you have recognized red flags such as significant loss in weight and appetite that should be taken more seriously. I hope this was useful. Best Wishes.",1,climate,pollen

835,"I have a rash . It started just on my ankles and is severely itchy. After a while it left my legs and moved farther up my leg. It has continued to do this moving in a very systematic pattern along my body. It is mirrored on either side, like currently it is on both of my wrist , the insides of my upper arms, my inner thighs and just around the sides of my back. When it first started it was only one or two bumps, slightly red much like an irritated hair follicle , at a time and they only lasted in one spot for a couple of days before moving. Now they show up in much larger patches 10-15 at a time and last for a weeks or so before they move. This started back in Nov. I have seen my gp for the problem and he just keeps on prescribing me allergy medicine, so far we have done a topical cream and a rx antihistamine, it was immediately after starting the antihistamine that my rash mutated into larger sites with longer breeding time. I need to stop itching, any thoughts!! I have also spent many hours scouring the interenet for any picture that resembles what I have and I absolutely cannot find anything that matches it.

836,"Hi. I get pains in my chest and upper back occasionally. About 18 months ago they got so bad that I was sent for an x-ray. It came back clear. They flared up again recently, and I had another taken. Again clear. The doctor said it must be costochondritis. I also suffer with pretty regular hoarseness and sore throats, plus whats been diagnosed as allergy-induced asthma (without inhalers I have random coughing fits). About a month ago the doctor gave me some antibiotics for a sinus/tonsil complaint. I have no cough. This week I again began to wake with chest pains, which became back pains later in the day. When I expectorated this morning I had mostly white sputum, but then two were a dirty green. More worryingly, one had a pea-sized lump of dark red blood in it. Almost purple. Should I go back to the doctor? Could the previous x-rays have been wrong? Or might it be a problem with my aesophagus?I am 37 and otherwise pretty fit, cycling for an hour a day and playing sport on the weekend. I dont smoke now, but did for about 15 years.","Hi. I can understand your concern.  Chronic cough is commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. Since your chest x-ray is normal, no need to worry about lung infection. Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",1,,

She has been on steriods and antibiotics for them and has been seen by an ENT specialist who has blown out the easier to reach sinuses. She still has the headaches, she also gets red plaques on her skin for no reason and then they go away. The specialist seems to think she has allergies and will test her next week with a special allergy test that is subcutaneous instead of the pricks on the surface of the skin. She has had several stents put in her heart several years ago and her breathing is not as good as it could be be other than that she is good. I am not convinced that it is allergies. Any ideas?","Hello, Headaches and night sweats can have several causes and hope the CT scan of the paranasal sinuses also covered the head and excluded intracranial pathologies.Also, thyroid function test would be an important test here. The red plaques are probably unrelated to the headaches and night sweats in time, and if they are itchy red lesions slightly raised and disappear without a trace it means urticaria eruptions. Here too thyroid autoimmunity plays a role and therefore best to exclude with TPO antibodies. I do not know what subcutaneous tests your doctor is going to offer but cannot be more sensitive than skin prick tests. Occasionally multiple cardiac medications can cause the urticaria, so please check these out and discuss with your doctor.80% of patients with urticaria do NOT have allergies.

The symptoms described you indicate that your son is probably having uncontrolled asthma. You also mentioned green/ yellow phlegm which is suggestive of infection resulting in exacerbation of asthma. As you told he is having the symptoms despite having ruler(formoterl-mometasone) so shifting to forecourt (formoterl-budesonide) or Aeroflot (salmeterol-fluticasone) may be a better option. Oral Prednisolone should not be used on a long term basis. It will make asthma dependent on steroid as well lead to many systemic side effects. There are many causes of difficult to control asthma.

It's an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up.

You said that you use regular nasal spray but forgot to specify type of nasal spray but I would suggest not to use it on daily basis cause there are many side effects like rhinitis medicament, and it also worsens the condition once you discontinue the spray which again leads you use it again (cycling process).

If it is chronic sinusitis then it can be treated by medication like antibiotics, anti histrionics and NSAIDs if it AO sever that it does not respond to above treatment then surgery can be done successfully.I hope this information will help to proper treatment.",1,,

Coughing/sneezing got worse then i spent Sun/mon in bed with a fever, chills, spine ache (hightest temp was 100.1).I took zyrtec-D, Monday, and that helped a quite a bit. My mucous has been clear...once or twice slightly green. But at the same time i have had chest congestion and coughed up green or brown loogies. Is that from laying down for two days? Am i contagious - as far as a cold goes? I have a temp again this am of 99.0.","Hello, thank you for posting your query here. Yes, you are still contagious for another 3 to 5 days. It is best to use cough etiquette when you are around other people-cough or sneeze into your shoulder (not your palms), or into a tissue which you dispose. As for the brownish phlegm, if your fever is settling and you're getting better overall, there's no need to worry about them. If you have difficulty breathing or a temperature more than 102 F, contact your physician. I suggest you take some anti histamines and montelukast if you are prone to allergies, as the climate will exacerbate your allergies. Hope I have cleared your doubts, get well soon!",1,,climate

As you have undergone absolute eosinophil count (AEC), which is also evident of some allergic reactions in the body. These dust can stimulate the mast cells to release mediators like histamine which is producing all these symptoms.

If they are due to allergy then you need to find out the allergen and must avoid further contact with that rather than just taking anti-allergic Chat Doctor. Runny nose is mostly due to viral infections of pharynx, sinus,larynx, epiglottis, bronchi etc.Sometimes it could be due to bacterial infection also.

However, this may seem but is usually not the case. What happens is that your allergies are getting worse, and once a day cetirizine is insufficient to make a difference to the symptoms. Avil injection is a short-acting but rapidly acting antihistamine with sedative properties and will NOT recommend this for long term use. You must get a blood test or specific IGE OR a skin prick test to find out what your allergies are. If it is house dust mite, avoidance measures should be in place but optimizing medical treatment with long acting antihistamines like Allegra and nasal corticosteroid sprays are recommended.

The rash is not raised from the skin surface. I have been taking an anti allergic (levocetrizine) for the last three days. Please help.","Hi, Is the swelling around face and feet pitting type (which can be indented on pressing)? Any change in color / amount / frequency of urine (suggesting renal causes of swelling)? If the swelling is non pitting, and no urine changes mentioned above, this is likely allergic, especially so because of the associated itchy rash. In such cases, I also used to give antihistamines for 5-7 days. Here I prefer older antihistamines like HY Chat Doctor.  If not responding in 3 days, after ruling out any precipitating factor like infection, I used to give a short course of oral steroids like prednisolone. Kindly discuss with your doctor.

There are other surrogate markers on blood tests to check for allergies like eosinophilic on blood count or IGE levels (raised).

However, for extensive disease systemic treatment with oral immunosuppresses like methotrexate, cyclosporin, Phototherapy (PVA), Biologics etc. may be required for disease control. Specific topical treatment options for psoriasis plaques are topical steroid with or without salicylic acid, topical vitamin D analogues like calcitriol, calcipotriene etc. These are available in ointment form for plaques involving the body and in lotion form for scalp psoriasis. Topical therapy may be combines with oral/systemic therapy for widespread/extensive disease. Besides specific remedies for psoriasis, moisturizers form an important part in the management of psoriasis because of the thick scaly nature of the plaques. Moisturizers enhance the penetration of topical active ingredients as well as prevents or delays side effects like skin atrophy etc. An oral antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg may be required for symptomatic relief from itching. Treatment may take 2-4 weeks to show noticeable improvement. Therefore, I would suggest him to continue with the prescribed medicines and follow up with his doctor every 2-4 weeks.

Let me advise you about tongue swelling. Swollen tongue is actually an abnormal condition in the tongue occurring due to tongue inflammation, where either a part or the entire tongue gets enlarged, and fatter than the normal tongue size. It is true that tongue in its swelling conditions is taken as a kind of defense mechanism which helps in fighting against the infection and aids in healing. However, when there is an excessive swelling for longer time; the swollen tongue can be actually very much harmful. It must be mentioned that tongue inflammation or the swollen tongue condition can result from the excessive fluid accumulation in the tongue tissues and termed as Angioedema. This swollen tongue can also occur due to excess deposit of abnormal substances like the amyloid protein and also can be result from any kind of allergic reactions to certain medicines.

953,"Hi,I never had allergies when I was growing up in South Africa.  I am now a au pair in the United States since June 2010.  Last week Thursday when I went shopping at a mall that I usually dont go to I tried out a perfume with my friend which I also do not usually do or wear.  I also tried on some clothes.  On the way home was the first time I remember feeling unwell.  My ears started burning so I took out my earrings.  Then that night my ears, eyes and neck were itching.  I sneezed for a few minutes after the perfume while in the mall but that was the only sneezing and there is no rash on my arms. The next day my eyes were swollen closed and I had a red like rash on my next and sandy grainy bumps behind my ears.  I can keep the swelling down quite a bit with benedril but after 5 hours it comes right back.  And although the swelling is down with the pills my eyes are really red, wrinkly, puffy looking.  This year i have removed 3 ticks after walks in the park.  The only unusual food in the last 7 days was a persimmon but I have eaten those earlier in the year and nothing happened.  I tried changing my soap and lotion yesterday and nothing changed.  Could it be that I ate some Christmas treat at church or Christmas smells in the stores?  Last year I had a cold at Christmas time and my eyes were fine and no rash.  Please help it looks like I have aged from 22 to 40 over night","Hello, I read carefully your query and understand your concern. Your symptoms seem to be related to an allergic reaction. There are many possible allergens that cause the allergic symptoms. The exact allergen can be confirmed through allergy tests. I suggest using antihistamines such as Cetirizine 10 mg daily. If the symptoms continue, you may need steroid shots. Hope my answer was helpful. If you have further queries feel free to contact me again. Kind regards!  Chat Doctor.",1,,

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. Telfast 120 is fexofenadine. Fexofenadine and nasal spray will help your nasal and throat symptoms of allergy but not asthma (noise from chest, feeling of being breathless).

What could be causing her back to itch? She says it could be that the baby has a blood type that she is allergic too, is this possible?","Greetings from Chat Doctor. Thanks for posting your query.  No that is not the cause of Itchy back. Most likely it is due to an allergy to one of her pre natal supplements.  I advise you stop one of the supplements for a week and observe, if there is a relief from itching then ask your doctor for an alternative for that supplement. If there is no relief then restart that supplement and stop the other supplement and observe.  Till then, she can apply a cream called Renovate over her back. Ask your doctor for the prescription.

I understand that you a fever associated with an itchy rash. From your history and description, the possibilities I would consider are acute urticaria and viral exanthemUrticaria presents with an itchy rash which is transient. It lasts for a few hours and disappears. It is raised and blotchy. Furthermore, it could be associated with swelling of the eyes and lips as well. Furthermore, it occurs secondary to the infection (fever) or sometimes as an allergy to a Chat Doctor.  (antibiotic, anti-fever medication, etc.). You can continue to take antihistamine like levocetrizine at bedtime for about 1 week. Viral exanthem is a rash which occurs as a part of the fever. It is in flush with the skin, starts on the face and spreads downwards. It is usually non-itchy, but sometimes can itch. Furthermore, it clears spontaneously within 5-7 days. Hope this helps you.

I do not cough during exercising","Hi, it could be possible to associate the cough to allergies, but I think other common causes of chronic cough must be evaluated. The first exam that will act as a triage is a chest X-ray. Infectious causes like pneumonia, pleurisy, aspergillus and some heart anomalies could lead to breathing difficulties. It is interesting to carry out a sputum exam especially with chronic coughs. Pulmonary Tuberculosis must be excluded in this examination, and presence of specific allergic bodies called Charcot Laden s bodies could suggest an allergic origin. Blood tests like measurement of Immunoglobulin E levels and a complete blood count, to show a rise in levels of Eosinophils to suggest an allergist origin. I suggest you visit your internist/pulmonologist for this allergic cause to be evaluated, and other common and serious respiratory tract infections like pulmonary tuberculosis be excluded.

Due to exertion during swimming, bronchoconstriction i.e. narrowing of air passage/bronchioles occurs resulting in reflex in the form of cough. Antibiotic donor play a role unless there is added infection.  In bronchial asthma or in bronchitis, bronchodilators are needed as they dilate the constricted air passage and gives relief in cough.

I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that you have Allergic Contact Dermatitis causing inflammation and bumps over the face due to allergic reaction to any of the cosmetic product that you have used. It is a bit difficult to explain that what is causing the allergic reaction without proper evaluation and investigations as dust, turmeric as well as expired cosmetic product all are potent agents that can cause allergy. Consulting an Allergist and getting evaluated will help you to rule out the exact cause of reaction. You should continue taking the anti allergic and other topical agents advised to you by your physician. For lubrication of skin you can use algebra gel. For facials use only dermatological tested branded products. Wash face frequently with cool water. Avoid exposure of skin to dust as well as over exposure to sun should be prevented.

The symptoms are runny nose, irritation in nose, sneezing etc. I take Levocetirizine which usually helps but some times it does not stop runny nose.Than I use Sinerest the combination contains Phenylephrine + Caffeine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol .

I am so sorry to hear about what you have been experiencing. Wheezing in most cases suggest an obstruction of the airways of which the most common cause is asthma. Allergy medications and Ventolin are meant to control the symptoms and not cure asthma. The main stem of treatment is identifying the provoking factors and preventing exposure to. Some include oil, pollen, dust, cold, exercise. Etc.depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may be required to take medications daily or only take Chat Doctor.

For prophylactic purpose, take Montelukast daily before coming into contact with triggering factors. For proper management of allergic rhinitis, find out factor (allergen) responsible for allergy. Or else you can contact allergy specialist to do skin allergy testing which will help to find out known possible allergens. Have a habit of taking antioxidant rich food like onion, garlic, dark chocolates, kidney beans etcetera. Do early morning Panama and yoga which will help you to boost up your immunity.

Urticaria is an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IGE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non-responding cases there are many other Chat Doctor.  Hope this will help you in resolving your query. Thank you",1,,

1052,"I had two ceramic bridges put in upper and lower.  I also had two extractions, one upper and one lower.  When the ceramic bridge was put it in, it hurt right away.  Now two months later, I have extreme pain in my inner cheeks almost feels like razor blades.  It comes and goes throughout the day and makes my eyes water with pain.  I went to the original dentist, talked to the oral surgeon, went to a doctor and an allergist.  No one can seem to know what it is.  You can see it, but it hurts like nerve damage and is getting worse rather than better.  Doctor prescribed prednisone and allergy tablets.  I dont know where to go next.","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint the ceramic bridge hurt you when itself shows that the pain is related to teeth only and chances of nerve pain are less. There is a possibility that you have high points over the bridge, and it is causing pain. It can also lead to pressure over the jaw joint causing jaw joint dysfunction. Other reason can be that the teeth over bridge is placed have exposed nerves that gets inflamed and irritated leading to pain. Although fewer chances but chances of nerve induced pain like Trigeminal Neuralgia cannot be ignored. I would suggest you to first consult an Endodontist or an Oral Physician and get a full mouth x-ray done to check for teeth as well as jaw joint. In case if there is any abnormality detected it will be treated accordingly. In case if still nothing is found you can consult a Neurophysician and get evaluated and an MRI can help in ruling out for nerve disorders and treated accordingly. As of now if pain is severe you can take Tramadol and for moderate pain you can take Ibuprofen. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.",1,,

These allergens can stimulate the mast cells to release the mediators of allergy like histamine, which will produce all these symptoms.

I would like to tell you one thing about the treatment of allergy. The only effective treatment of Allergy is avoidance of allergen (Triggering factor). Any substance could be an allergen. Most common allergens for NASA bronchial allergy are dust and pollen. As far as the monteluKast is concerned - this is not useful in treating acute attack of allergy. It will help in reducing the frequency of allergic episodes. For it to be effective you might have to use it for years (2-3 Years). In very rare cases may have to be used for very long periods. Rota caps will give you instant relief but will not affect the recurrence of allergic episodes. The only definitive treatment as I have mentioned earlier is avoidance of allergen. Just list out all the possible allergens with which you experience allergy. Try to avoid those allergens. Try using a cloth mask while going out. Using newer antihistamines like Fexofenadine 120 mg (Allegra) will help you to counter acute attacks. Get your Blood Eosinophil count done. Based on the result. You can use some medicines like DEC (Di Ethyl carbamide) which reduces the eosinophils and will prevent recurrent attacks of nasobronchial allergy. But please discuss with your doctor before you start using DEC. Hope you got some solution. Wish you a healthy day Take care",1,,"dust, pollen"

I will usually get sick with a head cold/ nasal cold, and the runny nose will redden but never develop a sore like the pictures on web demonstrate. At 42. In the last two days, I have developed a cold sore and the Dr. visually confirms that it is most likely Herpes. Although there was no itching or pain and the area on the lower lip inflamed after shaving. My lymph nodes under the chin are swollen as well. I am aware of contact dermatitis . Is there a possibility that it is not Herpes? greater than 1%.","Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor The sensitivity for herpes blood tests range from 91 to 99 %, the specificity is between 92 to 95%. High sensitivity and specificity means that there are few falsely negative and falsely positive results. If you've had repeated results that are negative then it is unlikely that you have herpes. If you wish you can repeat the test to see if infection occurred since you were last tested, but with this highly accurate test, negative usually means negative. I hope this helps",1,,
1078,"Hello there! Looking at the cut & paste below...I have the exact same problem! IDENTICAL! I bought a 6 pack of Scmirnoff Ice flavored drink - Screwdriver with 5.8% ABV. About 2 minutes after drinking I started having severe upper stomach and shoulder/arm pains LIKE I WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK!!! I immediately took some low dose aspirin and then noticed by face was turning a deep reddish color and I felt congested and uneasy. I had the same symptoms as the poster below. Really weird. Is it possible to be allergic to alcohol or is it a certain ingredient that causes this reaction? Seriously - my face turns beet red and the veins in my forehead stick out. YIKES! Stomach pain and shoulder pain when drinking alcohol. Rise in body temperature and redness in face Hi, Every time I drink alcohol with a high sugar content (UV Blue, Smirnoff Ice, etc.) I get horrible pains in my upper stomach and a dull throbbing in my shoulders. It s not something that has just happened, it s been going on for about 3 or 4 years. I m 20 and it only seems to be getting worse, I also notice a rise in body temperature and my face turns a bright shade of red. It typically only takes one mixed drink of UV Blue or two wine coolers for the pain to begin and the pain lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes. I m 5 2, 220 pounds, with pale skin, blonde, hair and blue eyes. I eat candy and drink soda with no problem. Its only alcoholic drinks with high sugar that cause the pain. Thank you!","Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, after a clinical examination, I would advise you for some routine blood tests like a CBC, LFT, Blood sugar, serum lipid profile, a serum amylase and lipase estimation and an ultrasound of abdomen, an x-ray chest, and an ECG to rule out problems related to biliary and pancreatic system and the cardio vascular system. Till then, I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor, an anti-spasmodic, and possibly a broad spectrum antibiotic for a symptomatic relief. Further management would depend on the reports of investigations. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

So only augmenting won't help. You can try out antihistamine like levocetrizine, nasal spray(alone twice daily for both nostrils), enzymes like lysogenic plus and montelukast (I prefer Singular 5 mg) once daily after discussion with your doctor and this will help him along with steam inhalation and chewing gum(to open gustation tube).

It looks like a fatty piece of raw meat, and has the same consistency. When i pull on it, it doesnt rip. Half an inch long.","Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor The discharge seen on coughing would be mucus that was present in the respiratory system as a result of your infection. Because it is mucoid, it would not rip or tear, just as your described. Fever does not usually occur in allergies, so the presence of fever indicates that you have an infection. Likely an upper respiratory tract viral infection. Since the cough is productive, in addition to your normally cough and cold meds, you may also want to use a bucolic. This is a medication to help break up mucus so that it can be expelled easier. They would be available over the counter. I hope this helps",1,,

But allergy should be treated in stepwise manner first if your symptoms is for few months a year like 2-3 months then you start an antihistamine which you have to take daily at night. If your symptoms still persist then your start using steroid nasal spray, it has no side effect, and it controls the allergy very well, and you should start 2 weeks before your symptoms start. If this also does not cure you.

You need to observe that after what specific things does sneezing occurs. This will tell you that you are allergic to what specific thing and then try to avoid it. If its soap then change brand. Acne usually occurs on face. What you have on back could be militia, but that needs a dermatological examination to confirm it. Treatment for it will be given by dermatologist after examination.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. There are many factors contributing to development of respiratory allergy in a child. Heredity, environment (pollution, humidity, temperature, etc.), dietary habits, etc. contribute to it. I guess your son has allergic rhinitis with childhood asthma.

1111,I recently at a stuffed mushroom and it contained feta cheese and I literally woke up about 30 minutes with hives and welts from scratching everywhere. I itch so bad it woke me up. I have since taken 3 Benadryl pills but I still itch. Should I wake my boyfriend up to go to the ER. And my tongue feels alittle sick. I have never been allergic to anything except flagyl.,"HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It would be best to be seen as soon as possible in the ER or your emergency doctor if your tongue is swelling. This can affect breathing and may indicate that you may have a very severe allergic response that would not respond to Ben Chat Doctor. In the ER, you may need steroids as well. You would need to avoid this allergen in the future. If you are not sure if it is the mushrooms or cheese then either avoid both or do allergy tests. I hope this helps",1,cheese,"mushrooms, cheese"
1112,"I ve had a recurrent rash for several weeks. My family practice doctor treated me for scabies which I knew I did not have. I have no none food allergies and have stopped eating and drinking everything that I think could be a contributing cause. Oddly, I had been craving tomato juice for weeks and couldn t get enough. That has passed. Also have been experiencing some odd discomfort at the base of my skull that seems to coincide with a weird sensation in my arms and hands. This has been going on for about six weeks. The rash seems to worsen during the evening with no triggers and is helped by lotion. The rash is more like welts than prickly heat and is not a wet rash. It is not hives; I ve had the reaction to shrimp. I don t like taking antihistamines and hence have not. Thanks.","Hello, If the rash that you describe is red, itchy, has raised skin that you can feel, goes away after a few hours only for new ones to appear in their place, does not leave a mark or bruise, then this is acute urticaria. That you have had it for >6 weeks, makes it chronic urticaria. 80% of people with urticaria do not have allergy, although a pre-existing allergy to (say) house dust mite, pollen or shrimp does not make it more likely for this type of urticaria to appear. Infections, underlying thyroid problems, diabetes, inflammation inside the body (can be several conditions, say endometriosis) and stress makes these lesions appear and can last quite long. The treatment (that you don't like) is the right one, long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like Allegra 180\u00a0mg once in the morning, and cetirizine 10\u00a0mg at lunchtime or evening for 6 weeks (max 3 months). Unless you continue on high dose antihistamines, this will recur. If you think you may have a thyroid problem, get TSH fT4 and TPO antibodies tested. If there is a chance of an infection, please get this checked and treated as well. I hope this helps. Best Wishes.",1,shrimp,"dust mite, pollen, shrimp"

Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days. If this happens, you can start using the same medicine.

Thanks for writing to us at heallthcaremagicJudging from the information that you have provided I will keep a possibility of a viral exanthem. I would specifically like to rule out Chicken pox, since as you say that the rash is composed of fluid filled lesions. Chicken pox classically presents with red lesions which later on become topped with fluid filled lesions. The lesions of chicken pox are mainly distributed on the trunk, face and proximal extremities. Palms and soles are usually spared. Fever and other systemic symptoms are present. I will suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist after examination would be able to either confirm or rule out chicken pox. Treatment of a confirmed episode of chicken pox is with oral antivirals e.g. acyclovir or val acyclovir. Symptomatic treatment for fever and malaise should be provided with OTC paracetamol and ibuprofen. Regards",1,,

The lesions may be elevated and discrete. I think probably you have lichen ultimatum.... also known as popular urticaria. It is a hypersensitive skin reaction to insect bite....

What can I do so I will stop touching and itching my face till I find a Dermotoligist?","Thanks for writing in Chat Doctor. You have to avoid the cosmetic creams or other cosmetics which may cause allergy on your face.  Wash your mouth three or four times in a day with water. Don't use excessive cold or hot water. Itching may be at least partially controlled with the use of low-sedating antihistamines. You can use lover, it will reduce the burning sensation of your face.  Protect your face from direct sunlight and dust. Avoid traumatizing the skin by keeping fingernails short and hands clean to avoid scratching and infecting the skin.

Allergy is caused when the body is exposed to a foreign substance that reacts with bodies antibodies and release chemicals causing symptoms of allergy. The sneezing you get is because certain foreign substances (allergens) enter your nose and respiratory organs to cause cold etc. You have to avoid allergens to prevent runny nose and sneezing, and if they happen, take recourse to antihistamines Chat Doctor.",1,,

1124,I have several sores in my mouth. It started on my lower lip as many very small bumps. They are not canker sores and now they are on the underneath of my tongue.  they are red an hurt.

As you have already suggested that you have shown allergic reactions to Motrin in the past which is also a NSAID(Ibuprofen). The mouth ulceration in the floor of your mouth is most likely caused as an allergic reaction to the NSAID ointment you rubbed on your hand. I would like you to visit your nearest Dentist to rule out any other cause. If you were my patient, I would have prescribed you with a Steroid Triamcinolone Acetonic cream 0.1% Mouth Ointment or any Topical Steroid If you were not allergic to steroids. Moreover, avoid spicy foods and Eat and Chat Doctor.  Rinse your mouth with Chlorhexidine mouth wash. Thanks and",1,motrin,motrin
