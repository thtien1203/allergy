In the meanwhile you can cover it over the body by wearing appropriate long clothes which can cover most of the body to hide it. If itching occurs then you can take cetirizine once daily to prevent itching. Hope this answers your question.

1,"Do you take multiple chemical sensitivities seriously and understand how debilitating fragrance chemicals are? Do you think there is always an under-lying cause for scent sensitivity/allergy (yes, I have allergic reactions to dryer sheets like Bounce and Scent Boosters)ie rash hot prickly skin, swelling of tongue, extreme thirst... do you think (my) immune system was already compromised or do you think the neurotoxic petro chemicals in fragrance products alone can cut a person s life down to the knees overnight?","It's a very good question and thousands of people who read it, I fact, can reap the benefits out of suggestions given herein, based on the principles of Ayurveda - the nascent science of life.First there is a principle cited in Ayurveda about how to prevent/ cure a disease. Its NIDAANPARIVARJAN (in Sanskrit language) which literally means avoidance of the cause. Now, in many cases people are not able to change jobs or circumstances are such that they have to remain in such conditions. Here comes the principle of PRAANVAYU (richness of oxygen and fresh air) that is achieved by rhythms of deep breathing exercises called PRAANAYAM. Indias Yoga has spread to the World and people who are aware are enjoying the benefits. It enhances immunity, gives strength to fight allergens and extends life as also betters quality of life. Then there are herbs to naturally support the fight of body against allergens. Simple herbs like Turmeric, Need, Manisha, Gilroy, Quasi (Holy basil) etc. not only counter allergens but detoxifies the blood and also raise natural immunity. The hitch among beginners is its slow pace of action. Yes naturals are slow as compared to man made synthetic and toxic medicines but then what advantage has these fast Chat Doctor.

Though in general if the tattoos are made in sterile procedure then there is no any harm of the same but in case if the tattoos are carved by unsterile needle or is made with infected needle then can transmit multiple infections. Temporarily it can cause secondary infection and later on the tattoos can cause permanent darkening of the skin which is actually difficult to be managed.

Geographical tongue is usually related to glossies, however, there are some instances that yeast overgrowth in the stomach can cause tonsils, pain in the submandibular lymph nodes/ pain and lymph adenopathy and later on will result to glossies. As we know that yeast can grow in an acidic environment and sugar-laden environment. However, there are several causes that the tongue may swell and that could be caused by allergens, nutritional deficiencies and/ or infections. If the swelling of your tongue/ glossies/ geographic tongue is caused by allergens then probably that is also the cause of your hives on the face.

They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct.

Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this?","Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for at least 5 days. If it was an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to, and you can avoid exposure to that in the future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause.

Second option we can think is any neurological lesion but usually swelling on hands along with feeling of swelling on head are not features.

MR scan will also show the sinusitis.Thanks, Hope, I cleared your doubt.",1,antibiotic

Welcome to Ask A Doctor.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  A side effect of Motrin(ibuprofen) is to cause stomach inflammation which can make the stomachs inside lining bleed. The blood is carried along with intestinal contents through the entire intestinal tract.  By the time it reaches the end it is black and makes stool black.  Blueberries, Pepto-Bismol, and iron supplements also make stool black.  A hive rash is an allergic rash and could be due to Motrin, especially if the hives appeared very soon after you gave him the dose.  Tylenol does not irritate the stomach and is safer.  Hard stool is usually due to not enough liquid intake.  You may want to try giving apple and pear juices.  If that doesn't help, prune juice, 1-2ounces one-two times per day might be beneficial.  Frequent colds and coughing could be from being in close contact with other young child Chat Doctor.  How old is your child?  Does he attend daycare?  Also, cold and cough syrups are NOT recommended to give to child",1,"motrin, ibuprofen"

In my opinion however it is very difficult to establish any diagnosis with this short history, but allergy is not responsible for such type of fever.

So consult a physician / surgeon and get his opinion because physical examination is important in this case. If there is fluid collection in sac of scrotum (testis) it don't produces fever.2 Tuberculosis, this is another most common cause of prolonged duration fever. Get in sputum examination for A F B, blood for E SR, X-ray chest, months test .3 Typhoid fever is one such cause of low grade fever. Get in Tidal test as well serology test for confirmation.

105,I have a 2.5 year old daughter (12.5 kgs) who is having cough since last 3 weeks. It looks like dry cough. There is no chest congestion but she has runny nose which is sometimes clear and sometimes yellow. Cough is worst when she sleeps. She was on bricanyl for last 3 weeks with no respite. Now she is prescribed Relent syrup 7 ml twice a day for 5 days and nasal spray Nasivion three times a day for 5 days.Does this look ok ? why would she be coughing so badly for last 3 weeks ?

I went through your daughters' history, its runny nose & cough without chest congestion for last 3 weeks. I guess fever is not a symptom here. Firstly, I would not suspect a serious condition here. I would think of either allergy or post-viral cough (it is common to continue coughing for some weeks, sometimes more than a month, after viral infection). Regarding treatment, I would suggest an antihistamines (such as cetirizine or levocetirizine) and montelukast daily for your daughter. This will take care of both nasal symptoms & cough. As nasal blockade is not a problem with your daughter, I would not suggest using Position for more than 3 days. Rather I would suggest nasal saline spray daily to irrigate nasal cavities. Antibiotics are not required for viral infections or allergies. However, if your daughter develops fever or fast breathing, I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician. Hope this will help you.

Individual lesions do not last for more than 12 hours and new ones appear, and it seems they are always there. Allergic reaction is only plausible if this was after a new medication, food you have taken and happens within a few hours. Painkillers are notorious to cause these reactions, but if you have not taken before an outbreak it is unlikely to be an allergy. However, medications can have a secondary effect on skin so do get your medications reviewed if you are on any. Urticaria is mostly nonallergic, although blood tests such as CBC, LFT, thyroid are necessary at some stage especially if conducting antihistamines over 3-4 weeks taken daily do not help.

129,"Help! I have urticaria on my buttocks and thighs - humidity and tight pants might be a factor. I first noticed the red irregular bumps on my buttocks about 4 years ago in the summer after returning from the beach/ pool. I continued to get it every summer since after sunbathing; it lasts for 2 to 3 weeks and then it goes away. This year however, I got it in February (I was pregnant at the time) and its been coming back on and off in small bumps since then. I finally saw a dermatologist who did a biopsy; the diagnosis- papular urticaria. In hope for an answer, I saw an allergist as well - turns out im allergic to dust mites and cockroach (not known to cause hives). Yesterday I went to a hot yoga class; the room was warmer than usual and i sweated profusely. I got home and my right thigh was covered in red bumps of different sizes, some even expended into a massive red area overnight - they are somewhat itchy and my skin feels as sensitive as when I get sunburn. My left thigh is not as affected - just a few red bumps. I take Allegra on a regular basis and I used anti - itch lotion  for the first time today (Itch Fix,  i believe). I do not have any other medical condition aside from Thalassemia minor. The rash seems to have gotten worse since it first started 4 years ago, it really worries me. What else should i look into? What steps should i take?","Hello friend, I am a Homeopath and so my answer will be different from what you have already heard about allergy. Yes you are allergic to several things like heat of summer, dust, mites, cockroach etc. This hypersensitivity is inborn or genetic. But the time of developing hypersensitivity is related usually to a psychological conflict you had at the time of onset of the problem. If you started getting it 4 years back, exactly before that you must have had some shocking conflict which remain unresolved. But your brain associated the urticaria to the external environments like heat of sun, dust etc. instead of associating with the conflict. Now your brain has made a program associated with these factors and whenever you get exposed to such environments you get the symptoms of urticaria. First if you can recollect the conflict, then you can resolve it at the mental level. How you reacted to that is important because that is your genetic, constitutional individuality that made you to react in that manner. This will help the Homeopathic physician to select the constitutional remedy for you. Therefore, my advice to you is to approach an expert Homeopath at the earliest. You should stop taking any anti- Chat Doctor.  Once you are cured, then your urticaria will go away. With best wishes,",1,dust

If it has stopped after your infection is cured then you can stop worrying about it. Now about your asthma, Pulmicort 200 which you take is budesonide, which is steroid. And Symbicort which your son uses is budesonide plus a long acting bronchi dilator. Ideally when inhalers are given it is adjusted to minimum dose at which patient is comfortable. Since you where comfortable on Pulmicort 200 you should continue the same thing. But for now until you get medical attention you can take Symbicort 100, 4 puffs 2 times, if you have heart problem, or you are old you should go to your doctor before starting your sons' inhaler.

In Homeopathy, we take into consideration you the mental, physical and general symptoms to find out your constitutional remedy. My advice is to approach an expert Homeopath at the earliest.

However, I now have a sore tongue that feels thick and as though it was burned, with some small blisters on it, also some blisters around my mouth, and I also have a sore throat.  Is this an infection, or could it be an allergy or an immune disorder?","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The pain in the jaw could be because of the disc displacement in the TMJ. It can also occur secondary to impacted wisdom teeth or any infection from the other teeth. You need to consult an oral physician and take a radiograph to rule out the above-mentioned conditions. If it is TMJ disorder you can take proximal tablets, follow soft diet, do not open your jaw too wide. Give hot fomentation over the jaw joint. If it is tooth infection then you can take a course of antibiotics and analgesics like amoxicillin 500\u00a0mg and metronidazole 400\u00a0mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Then treat the tooth with root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth. The soreness and blisters over the tongue and mouth could be secondary to herpes virus infection. This is a self limiting conditions but for the pain you can take topical anesthetic and analgesics like Anabel gel. Do saline gargling.

167,"For almost 6 months now, I have been plagued with a runny nose, itchy eyes, and a red spotted rash that comes and goes. My rash tends to be small red dots, splotchy, and very itch. My nose runs clear, and runs at home and at work.  I have been living in Beijing for 3 years now, and have been working at a small kindergarten for 2 years. The only thing that has changed in my lifestyle/life is the location(classroom) that I am teaching in. I believe it is dust mites, but I have been fighting them for months to no avail.

If it is another kind of mite, what should I do?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I would suggest you to take regular montelukast and levocetirizine. If this does not improve your nasal symptoms, I would suggest taking intranasal corticosteroid spray for 1-2 weeks. In addition, daily nasal cavity irrigation with saline nasal sprays 3-4 times a day will also help. Usually regular treatment of nasal symptoms will also take care of eye symptoms. I would also suggest washing your eyes with clean water 3-4 times a day, that will help in addition. Levocetirizine and montelukast will also work for skin symptoms. For identification of allergy causing allergens, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise you allergy testing and help to identify the allergen. Common allergens are apart from house dust mites, molds, pollen, animal dander, cockroach and other insects, etc. As general measures, I would suggest you to avoid dusts, smokes and air pollutants as much as possible. Please have a nutritious diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,"dust, mite, pollen, animal"

I am a waitress by trade and gave it up a few years back because I was so weak and the headaches were that severe. I never fully understood how my health seemed to have improved the past few years some because now I tend bar and work in second hand smoke . I have had some down time but not like in the past. The past several months I have learned on my own not by a doctor that I severly reacted to anchovie paste that was used in a recipe made by a friend. I have eaten ceasar salad for as long as I can remember. I then had an experience with scollops more body pain and some thoat pain. But before the Christmas Holiday I had a few calamari and then I knew i was on track to all of my unexplained health. My throat closed so bad but I felt like someone had kick bocked my chest and could not expand it at all and get air. I have had this before but not this bad and never fully understanding why it happens. Five weeks back it was a haddock dinner at a local restaurant that had just opened. My throat felt like I had thyroiditis for weeks. I did loose my voice some etc.. I am afraid and will seek medical help eventually. At the moment I am just so mad that it took this long for me or anyone to put together. There is not a specialist I have not seen. I am 54 and it all started at age 39 which is the age I went back to work. Never did I see this connection until recently. When we started to sell Lobster and Steamers I went out of work and thought my symptoms getting much worse had to do with this. I went to an allergist who told me that I was developing a sensitivity but focused on celiac disease and that road ended when my GI doctor ruled it out. I now have seveve ischemic colitis and have been kept overnight in hospital for blood pressure dropping low and another time for intestnal bleeding. My questions are these. Will this heal. I cannot sit for any period of time because of my intestines and cannot lift much because of all that feels damaged inside most days.

She had seen prior the same allergist that I had gone to before. Can allergies to seafood and shellfish be trickey to catch???????

Then I was rushed in and told my appendix but the hospital record shows them circuling they were normal. When I kept going back with the same repeated symptoms stating it is the same pain as before the appendix he yelled I only had one. I said I knew. He moved to Florida shortly after and I have lived years very sick. I had also moved at this time and four restaurants across the street that sold seafood. This is when I was originally sent to be tested for MS the first time. Major swelling, headaches, and no feflex response on left side.

Is there something else I should be taking?","Hello Thanks for posting here. Your symptoms like runny nose, sore throat, cough, hives all point out that you may have allergic rhinitis. The upper airways i.e. your nose, throat are reacting unusually to some substance which can be present in the air, in your surroundings. Usually most common allergens are smoke, dust, pollen, pet hairs and some food products also etc. So get your house vacuum cleaned, stay away from pets and gardens. It can also be worsened due to climatic conditions. There are blood allergen tests and skin prick allergen tests which can determine what are you allergic to, so that you can take necessary precautions. For your symptoms you can take tablet montelukast FX 10MG once in the night for about 14 days. This tablet is a combination of montelukast and fexofenadine which will definitely take care of your hives, runny nose and other symptoms. Also do a spirometry which shows functional capacity of the lungs. Allergies can also involve the lower airways causing asthma. It is a test in which you are required to blow into a machine to test your lungs functional capacity. If spirometry shows reversible obstruction then you must be started on inhalers also.

Fever, joint pains, rash that does not disappear but looks like a bruise or leaves a scar needs further investigating to ensure that it is not a form of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels). However, just a fever is not suggestive of this condition, and a viral infection triggering the itchy rash is usually the most likely explanation. If the fever continues, do ensure an infection screen is done, and you are on the right antimicrobial but continue on the antihistamines until the rash is well gone for 2 weeks and then stop the antihistamine tablets.

Another common cause of coughing is reflux or heartburn. Symptoms of this include experience a burning pain in the middle of the chest, sour taste in the mouth, and coughing especially when lying down flat.

Some people find benefit from using a wedge pillow or elevating the head of their bed to reduce reflux of stomach acid into the airway. Asthma is also a common cause of cough that can be triggered by cold weather. Asthma may not cause any abnormalities on routine pulmonary function tests (breathing tests).

He started with itching on his forearm & top of hand about a week ago and then followed tiny bumps you couldn t see unless you really looked closely..Shortly after his chest,arms,legs,tops of feet,and hands were covered in what looks like a rash of some sort.. His hands are the worst.. He has tiny bumps that are filled with clear fluid and come in groups or single spots.. He says they do not hurt just feels really gross.. I have had scabies before and they look NOTHING like that.. We went to the ER today and the doctor told him it looks like a food allergy and prescribed him prednisone and atarex .. I m not sure he is happy with the diagnosis so I am trying to get a second opinion","Hello, It is not common to develop a food allergy at this age although not impossible. If the rashes he had developed were definitely after eating a specific food (which must happen every time) then a diagnosis of rash secondary to food allergy is plausible. What you describe is something like cholinergic urticaria, a form of urticaria (this is not allergy in >80% of cases) that is triggered by temperature changes and mast cell release of mediators like histamine. Scabies is also a possibility that is intensely itchy and needs to be excluded with a careful examination, skin scrapings or a course of treatment if there is high clinical suspicion. Atarax is a strong antihistamine (sedative, so take at night) and prednisolone must be stopped after 5 days giving Atari a chance to work. You can switch to non-sedative antihistamines like fexofenadine or cetirizine. There is no blood test for a definitive diagnosis but thyroid disease or diabetes need to be excluded along with a complete blood count to ensure there is no infectious trigger. Hope that helps.",1,None

Summer/spring allergies are fairly common due to more dust, pollen in the air, as well as sun. Since you are unable to narrow down the cause, I would advise you to take precautions during this season. Wear comfortable cotton clothing, covering as much skin as possible. Avoid midday sun exposure. Always use a sunscreen. Wash hands, face when you come back from outdoor activity. Shower with warm water and apply a good moisturizer immediately after like Detail DAM or an intensive moisturiser. Avoid fragrances and strong chemicals in soap, lotions. When you have active rashes try to avoid commonly allergy causing items like nuts, seafood etc.Also, during rashes take an antihistamine tablet once daily like fexofenadine and apply calamine lotion over the area when irritation occurs. In case of severe redness or actively spreading rash in the summer, use a fluticasone cream for about a week over the rashes and stop. Continue the other tips advised. You can consult a dermatologist regarding certain skin allergy tests and blood tests which can point out the substances you are allergic to. Hope this helps.",1,"dust, pollen, nuts"

I m now concerned about her liver/kidney function and at this point I don t plan on going back to the prescribing doctor in reference to asthma issues. I read in Prescription for Nutritional Healing that wheezing can persist up to a month and my sister read that she was treated for acute asthma. How is acute asthma determined?

What s wrong? What do I do? It s been like this since yesterday. Thanks","Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. We call this Phenomenon as Triple response of Lewis. This is due to scratch on the skin. You had scratched the skin due to itching. In allergy, there is an increased release of a chemical called Histamine by Mast cells in our body. This histamine can cause itching, and thus you had scratched the skin. This scratching lead to erythema (redness) due to blood vessel dilation locally and increased permeability in blood vessels. These may look like red and pink dots. This is normal, and it can disappear in 30 to 40 minutes, once the histamine is broken down into inactive chemicals.However, in more than half of the peoples with high dose of allergens, this may persist and lead to late phase reaction up to 24 hours to 48 hours and then disappears.Thus, nothing to worry about, you can wait up to 48 hours. Please take antihistamines like cetirizine and mast cell stabilizers like montelukast. This will help in further release of anti-histamines from mast cells. Hope this helps.

Your symptoms of giddiness, fatigue, pica are all pointers for anemia. That does not necessarily mean you have thalassemia.2. Severe anemia with microcytic RBC's is commonly caused by iron deficiency. 3. Other causes of microcytic anemia are Chronic diseases/ thalassemia.4.

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Bee sting can result in secretion of histamines in our body leading to an allergic response, which can be aggravated if the body is allergic. Pain in finger will subside in due course of time. You can do hot fomentation for relief. If the pain is unbearable, you can take painkiller like Ibuprofen one tablet twice a day after meals along with an antacid.

What can be the possible cure and will multivitamin tablets would be of any help?,"HIT hanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor.  See you are having high eosinophils due to you're allergic. This condition is called Atop. This is a hereditary condition where your body produces excess of Eosinophils in response to dust / Smoke / Cold Air or certain food or medicines.  The best possible cure is avoidance of the allergen, dust in your case.  Apart from avoidance there is one more modality of treatment called Allergen Desensitization. In this condition first you will be tested for what dust you are allergic and once that is found you will be injected small but incremental quantities of dust over a period of 6 months. But this procedure is used only is serious cases.  Multivitamins will not help. Take more of Pomegranate, ginger and black pepper.  Also ask for Montelukast+ cetirizine medication prescription, and you can use it whenever sneezing is too much. Hope this information was useful to you. Any clarifications feel free to ask.

323,"I am an 18 year old female. when I was 3, I went to the hospital for croup cough and they had to shove a balloon type thing down my throat to open up my lung. This past year, I have had bronchitis or some other kind of lung infection 5 times, each time worse than the last. the cough I get with these infections will last weeks after other symptoms go away, along with coughing up mucus. I just completed a round of Biaxin to treat my latest infection, but with this infection came fevers, headaches, and a lot of shortness of breath and chest pain, all which are still lingering. My mom insists on sticking with my pediatrician to figure out what is going on with me, but I feel there is only so much they can do. I had a chest scan and a blood test for CBC, sed rate, and allergies. everything came back normal. along with the chest pain, shortness of breath, occasional fevers, headaches and bark-like cough, sometimes producing mucus, I have had some lower back pain, and have been overly sensitive, like crying super easily, like during a tv show happy or sad moment or a minor issue, which I did not normally used to do. I am generally happy overall and enjoy my life, friends, and job, so it is not depression or anything like that. The only medication I take is birth control and now an inhaler to try and help the labored breathing. I also bruise super easily, sometimes out of no where. I had a few tests done at a hematologist a few months ago, but nothing conclusive came from it, I am not sure if that is relevant. Does anyone know what could possibly be going on with me? Thanks!","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of either bronchitis or Pulmonary embolism is more. Birth control pills can cause Pulmonary embolism. So in my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) 2. CT Pulmonary Angiography. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need additional inhaled bronchodilators and oral bronchodilators also.  CT Pulmonary Angiography is needed to rule out Pulmonary embolism. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

326,My husband is a truck driver and drives about 400 miles a night. He used to be over the road but now comes home every night. He has only been driving truck for a little over 2 years and before that he was a water treatment specialist. This year he got sick a couple times and although he feels better his back is hurting him to the point of causing him to catch his breath. He has no other symptoms but he does drink energy drinks at work. The pain is to the right of his spine in the lower thoracic/ upper lumbar area. It seems too close to the spine to be kidney and as I said no other symptoms. This has been going on for about 2 weeks and seems to be getting worse. He is allergic to aleve which makes me nervous about giving him other NSAIDs. Aleve makes his face swell. Soaking in super hot water seems to help temporarily. I also did some tennis ball massage on what felt like a trigger point and that helped for a couple days but now he seems to be worse and I am afraid to touch him. He is a veteran and his next VA appointment is in June but to get in before that is impossible.,"Hithanks for writing to ChatDoctori have gone through your query, keeping in mind his suffering my advice would be to have X-ray dorsolumbar spine along with routine blood test for HE, TLC,DLC, ESR and sugar.

Never ever do this again as allergic reactions go on increasing in the severity with each episode & you may put yourself in life-threatening situation.

I always had a slight what I would describe as a slight soft fatty tissue under my skin under my hairline the size of a penny. It was not noticebale except to me really. This created a small soft bump. Not really a problem physically or appearnce wise. Recently I got a haircut and couple people asked me if I bumped my head. I had not but they noticed the bump. I figured it was because of my shorter hair they noticed the bump. Well 2 weeks ago I noticed the area was inflamed & reddish. I assumed it was an acne eruption or I got a chemical reation to something at work. I treated area with heat pad & ice along with some cortizone cream. The skin broke and now their is a soft tissue that protrudes up slightly. It does not hurt when I press down but creates a bump and is reddish. I treated it with iodine and hydrogen peroxid. It is not infected. Just seems like what I thought maybe was a small cyst is on my forehead. I rubbed the cortizone cream on the wound whch is size of a penny. The wound is not really healing after over 2 weeks. It s not an open wound. Just the skin is very rawish looking and pink. When I rub on the sac like cysts it feels tough like cartliage rather than skin. I am going to see my primary care doctor a board certified internist. I was curious based on my description what you thought it might be and if in your opinion with proper care. That I might be able to get my forehead looking like it used to be. As for now I am walking around with a regular sized bandage on my forehead which is kinda embarrassing. As I said it s not bleeding, nor does it hurt. Just looks like I have a sore that has not healed on my forehead. My thinking is it s a cyst of some kind that needs either antibiotics or possible removal. As I said it s size of a penny. If it were not on my forehaed I would not be as concrned as I am. It s worrying me that I am permanently going to be disfigured or something. Thank You-----Tim In Indianapolis.","Hi, Tim. If you're not experiencing any other symptomatology, yes, its most probably a cyst, a fibrous or even a lipoma based from your description. And the definitive treatment for that is surgery or excision biopsy. If you're concerned aesthetically, you could opt for a plastic surgery consult. But it's a surgery that could easily be done by a general surgeon as well. Usually, the surgeon will cut along the lines of your skin, as minimal as possible, to remove the cyst. After the surgery, inflammation will be observed. But few days after, it will resolve and heal accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.",1,"iodine, antibiotics"

The condition that you describe is consistent with urticaria, and very itchy red hives that fade away but reappear within a few hours. Some attacks on the skin are raised and known as angioedema due to the chemical called histamine released from mast cells. These cells are present in the lips, tongue, skin, chest, gut etc. and therefore wherever histamine gets released, you get the specific organ related symptoms. Another condition called urticaria vasculitis definitely needs to be excluded and Moreno when there is no response to antihistamines.80% of people with urticaria do not have any allergies which is the case with you. Long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like fexofenadine 180\u00a0mg once daily plus/minus cetirizine 10\u00a0mg at lunchtime/evening is required for 3 months. Occasionally the treatment may need to be longer if there is a recurrence. Tests such as CBC, Lots, renal profile, TSH TPO abs are standard investigations to exclude a secondary cause. Most people go into remission so do not worry. Thanks.",1,None

Cheers, Angel","Thanks for putting up your query at Chat Doctor. I understand your concern for your 4-year child. Do not worry about the antibiotic azithromycin. It is safe and effective. Unfortunately, sinuses are air pockets deep inside our face and their blood supply is poor, and often the antibiotics cannot reach there to make an effect. So, at times no antibiotic is successful in providing good relief and hence it is difficult to cure sinusitis. But generally the ailment comes down with age. I guess that you have to be a bit patient and wait to see if they give your son relief. Steam inhalation is a very effective method where water vapor goes deep inside and dilutes the cough and eases the situation. I hope that helps.

Is it allergic or something else?","Welcome to the ChatDoctorIn my opinion, your child may have any of the following problems;Food Allergies - Some individuals are allergic to certain types of food. Milk, eggs, peanuts, seafood, and soy are popular sources of food allergens. Although food allergies result in several overt physical signs and abnormal systemic changes, integumentary (skin) changes may prove to be the most noticeable of them all. Itching of the palms and soles of the feet is one of the earliest signs of a food allergy. Eczema - This is a broad disease condition that has many subtypes that are mostly characterized by itchy palms, feet, and the skin in general. A less common type of eczema is known for its hallmark symptoms of itchy palms and soles of the feet. This condition is known as Delhi Chat Doctor.  The digits (fingers) also itch on their sides. The itchiness worsens during nighttime and during warm weather conditions. Atopic dermatitis - This is just one subclass of eczema characterized by flaky, scaly, thick, very itchy, and reddened skin rashes. The cause of atomic dermatitis has been attributed to histamine intolerance and allergy, among other causes. Treatment for itchy palms will have to depend on what's causing it. The challenge, though, is that some doctors and dermatologists have a hard time diagnosing the exact condition. Nonetheless, treating the root cause of the itch will eventually halt the symptoms of itchy palms. For food allergies, you need to identify and avoid the allergen. Most forms of eczema have no real treatment. The management is just centered on relieving symptoms, most especially the itchiness felt. For atomic dermatitis, treatment is primarily centered on good skin care and the application of emollients that relieve swelling and allergic reactions. Antibiotics, antihistamines, and steroids are jointly used to relieve itchy palms and itchiness in general. For definitive diagnosis, I would advise a dermatologist opinion.

406,"Hi. I have a family history of allergies/sinus problems as well as a tendency - the past few years - to clench my teeth while sleeping. This makes me a TMJ candidate. As a consequence, when I developed an on again, off again ear pain in early June, I did not rush to the ENT. I did not seek any medicine. Last week however, I saw the dentist about a tooth on the same side as the ear pain (my lymph node was also briefly swollen under that ear ), he advised me to see an ENT to cover all bases. I was then given Augmentin for any that infection may have not been visible on the dental x-ray near the tooth (it has a crown). My ear does not feel particularly bad since I started the antibiotic. The lymph node swelling went down a few days ago after that visit and as of now my external auditory meatus feels just a bit crusty but is not particularly painful. Is it imperative that I see an ENT to determine for certain whether I have been suffering from an off again on again ear infection since June or should I wait to see how I feel after I finish the antiobiotics?","Hello dear,First, the antibiotics prescribed by your doctor is correct. Please take them as advised. However, if the symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult an ENT specialist for further evaluation & management.

438,"As of tomorrow evening it will have been an entire week that i have had hives and swelling. It started last thursday, about two to three hrs after eatining various fish fry samples and two different samples of soup that I later found out had crayfish and lobster pieces in it. By friday evening (the next night) it had gotten worse (even though I took loratidine and a few doses of hydroxyzine ). I should note that Ive never had a seafood allergy so I didn t think anything of associating eating it with the problem. However I had started dicyclomine for a different issue 3 days prior to the onset of symptoms, which I discontinued immediately assuming it was the source of reaction... So that friday at dinner I didn t think it would be a big deal to eat steak and 3 shrimp. Within 2-3 i hrs my lips/face swelled up significantly. Took more hydroxyzine, the face swelling went down a bit by morning, but throughout that day, saturday, my hands and feet swelled up before my eyes to the point that making a fist hurt and became impossible, and when walking the bottoms of my feet hurt like I had bruises. That evening I switched to benadryl , added zantac , and began zyrtec instead of loratadine the next morning. Finally on Sunday went to urgent care as swelling/hives/itching was intolerable. Was prescribed 5 days of 60 mg of prednisone and advised to continue antihistamine regiment, and given a epipen rx to keep on hand if breathing became difficult. Tomorrow will be 5th day on prednisone but still wake up with hives, severe itching and mild swelling. I almost used the epipen on Monday because I thought my chest was tight but after taking my dose of prednisone it eventually subsided. What do I do? Prednisone helps but relief is mild and seems to be short lived, lasting a few hrs to 12 hrs max. I can t take it anymore. Why would I still have reaction if it was the seafood? I have never had food allergy, only hives and mild swelling when taking various antibiotics. I did have a retreatment of a root canal by an endodontist on a molar the friday afternoon prior to the reaction (almost an entire week went by with no hives, just mild swelling on cheek near tooth). Sorry for so many details but I need help! Am I going to end up needing longer prednisone therapy? Why hasn t it helped more by now? Is that typical? Any advice on what to do and expect? I am a 27 yr old female, and am allergic to at least 10 antibiotics. Lastly, am in anatomy and have been working with a human cadaver and dissecting cats twice a week for several weeks, and earlierly on the day this all started I dissected a cow eye, but wore latex free gloves of course. I can t pinpoint the source so maybe I m still being exposed? Im clearly going to have to go back to the doctor but I d like to know what to expect... Thanks in advance!","Hello, You are clearly in distress with the acute generalized urticaria and angioedema episode and not helped by the fact that even prednisolone is taking its time. It is unlikely seafood allergy as the reaction does not proceed for so long even though all of us think of an event as the trigger. Most allergists though would like to ensure you have a blood test against the food panel that you had on the day and of course, shrimp crab lobster etc. by a specific IGE blood test. Skin testing would be required at a later stage (if blood tests are negative) and you are off all antihistamines for 2 weeks. Saying that, I think all of them will be negative (i.e., no allergy) and at the same time you ought to get a blood test for CBC, LFT, creatinine, Mast cell treatise, IGE, TSH TPO antibodies as the urticaria may have an autoimmune component. Prednisolone is reserved for the end if antihistamines do not work, but ultimately all will work once this acute phase is over. If you have required 30-40\u00a0mg for more than 10 days, it is best you slowly taper it down and stop at 6 weeks. By then, fexofenadine 180\u00a0mg and HY Chat Doctor.  20% do not respond to several antihistamines, and would need steroid sparing agents that must be discussed in detail with your doctor.

However doctor asked the symtoms and confirmed that she is suffering with allergic bronchitis.

Allergic bronchitis is caused by a specific allergen. This particular condition is triggered by an overly active immune system that attacks harmless foreign substances that enters the body. The immune system identifies the foreign substance as dangerous and releases antibodies to fight the substance. Allergic bronchitis can effectively be treated by having the right information about the disease and also being informed on what kind of allergen is causing the irritation. You can go for a series of test of the particular allergens that causes the irritation. Normally, prevention of allergic bronchitis will include staying away from the allergens that causes the condition. You have to consider that allergic bronchitis may worsen during the summer months as there will be a lot of allergens available. By carefully managing allergic bronchitis, your daughter will be able to live a normal and productive life. Hope this helps. Thanks and Regards.",1,None

Also take doxycycline 100\u00a0mg once daily for 3 weeks. Use a regular toothpaste. Do not change your paste and mouthwashes often. You will require a biopsy for a definitive diagnosis as many conditions will cause this. Please see your oral pathologist to get this done.

He says that he feels alright, and there is no pain in his ears, throat, mouth eyes or nose. Should we take him to see a doctor?","Hi Thanks for using Chat Doctor. It sounds more like an allergic reaction.Maybe he is allergic to some food which he had last night, or he was stung by some insects overnight. As long as there is no problem with breathing which is seen in severe allergic reaction, I would reassure your child and give him antihistamine if you have it at home and then take him to your doctor. It is advisable to have antihistamine at home in the first aid box but check the expiry date now and then.",1,None

He will require oral antibiotics with antipyretic, antihistamines in syrup formulations. Now, if he has been diagnosed with asthma already then he would require bronchodilators like beta agonists and anticholinergics in MDI with spacer as child cannot synchronize himself.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I think you have food allergy related to non-veg diet and what we call \""solar urticaria\"". Talking about food allergy, it is very important to know your symptoms related to consumption of food. Usually they are immediate itching, rash, swelling after consumption of food. If it is so, I would suggest you to avoid the food you are allergic to for at least 6 months. Afterwards you can try to eat in small quantity to see whether you react. If you are not sure exactly to which non-veg food you are allergic to, I would suggest you to observe closely your diet and symptoms. Most common non-veg foods causing allergy are fish, shell fish, eggs, etc. Regarding sun allergy (solar urticaria), I would suggest you to take daily levocetirizine and montelukast for a month & use a good sunscreen lotion. Please protect your skin from direct exposure to sunlight. Vitamin A rich food like carrots, mango, green leafy vegetables will also help. Stress/tension can aggravate allergies, so I would recommend you daily relaxation and meditation. This will help you in a long run. Hope this will be useful to you. Wish you the best of the health.

This hyper responsiveness is may be due to exposure to the triggering factors which may release mediators of allergy and produces the symptoms.

Since you are already having allergies, exposure of those allergens can cause allergic reactions in nose and lungs. So in my opinion, you should follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.  1. Avoid allergen exposure. 2. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. 3. Start Montelukast (anti-allergic) and Fexofenadine (antihistamine) combination once a day at night before going to sleep.4.

In and around my actual anus it is very itchy and has been for years. I try cortisone creams live Walgreens etc but the cream itself makes the condition worse. Prescription strength corticosteroid make it go away and I have even gone so far as to spray the area with flonase nasal spray my mother used for her allergies but I noticed that after I did that I got stretch marks on my lower belly which are now going away. The folds between my buttocks cheeks are now left to right brown/red stained or strangely pigmented mirror images of each other. The texture of the skin is otherwise normal with no skin tags or warts . The area directly around my anus is flaky and itchy and I can peel it off like onion skin. I am a male 46. I have gained a lot of weight slowly over the past 8 years ( about 50 pounds) and I am under psychiatric care for panic and anxiety but in reality I can t climb stairs or walk fast because I get light headed -- this is not panic -- I just assume it is because I am too afraid to let an MD touch me unless its to see a psychiatrist -- I am now taking 4mg alprazoloam per day and mg Inderal. Sometimes the symptoms are better but overall I am severely agoraphobic and my life is awful -- I do not feel like a normal person and it s not mental. I work as a writer and I write very well but my mind is very screwed up. I scare easily and things that would normally just annoy someone, make me get very weak where I have to lie down and sleep -- when I can sleep -- if I am out in the sun or I get hot I feel awful and if my shower is too warm I take hours and hours to cool off. I also have wheezing when I get nervous -- like taking a shower. The wheezing is not that bad but I can feel it. I cannot lift or carry anything -- I get so weak so fast that I have to lie down and rest -- sometimes it takes days to get over this. This atrted in 2006 with a full blown panic attack and some kind of subsequent nervous breakdown but prior to that I was fearful of cold sores which wi Oulw get once every two years -- most of this started after the death of my younger brother which was very bad but I find it hard to believe that everyone else in my family is okay, but I am this big fat, sweaty, out of breath, itchy assed, guy who can no longer work or do anything sociable without having a glass of wine -- if I try to take less xanax I get horrible withdrawal symptoms -- all it does not is keep me from getting withdrawal -- there is really no ther purpose for taking it.. Also, this all started at the same time I developed a lot of discreet keratosis on the backs of my hands and the tops of my feet.","Hi. I realize the feeling you have with all those conditions. Itching and flaking around the anus and in the buttock area, which tend to be moist is likely due to fungal infection. Fungal infections are notorious to get better with steroids, but recur in the same areas causing a vicious cycle with their use. Blood stains occur due to repeated excoriation and itching and the area becomes macerated when moist. So please get a fungal smear of the area, to see for fungal elements which can be then taken care of by keeping the area Chat Doctor.  Also check your blood glucose profile checked because this may be the harbinger of diabetes, which you are prone to being obese. Steroids would cause skin atrophy and stretch marks on repeated use and needs to be stopped, as also can it cause systemic side effects with repeated use. Hope I have answered your query.

558,"I had some allergy from UV rays or sunlight on my face skin two years back and a doctor advised me to use flutavate. I used it twice a day for a week and then daily for almost a month. And then I had been using it on alternate days for more than a year untill I realised it had some strong steroids. As Ileft using it, the skin beacme red and itchy and flaky too. Anything that I used lead to itching.Then I consulted a homeopathic docctor who suggested aggravating all the allergy and then healing it. As he gave medicines to aggravate it, the face skin turned as if it was burnt. The face gave a burning sensation for four full days; then the skin dried and peeled off. He asked me to just apply coconut oil all over the face.A month went by and things did nt improve. There were a lot of scars /black spots and pimples on my face. I visited another skin specialist and she said it is because I left applying flutave altogether which has some strong steroids. So she said we should slightly switchover to some milder steroids. She suggested using glycerine and rose water for moisturizing skin and using HHzole for a week, then Desowen (Galderma India) for another week and then Clearz Ultra Gel. Now she has asked using Desowen on alternative days and then twice a week. It has been a week that I am using clearzultra gel daily. The skin has started clearing but I am afraid of any further steroids.I want to get rid of any harmful medicines and creams and switch to a usual helathy skin care regime. Look forward to your suggestions.","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, For complete treatment of the skin allergy to UV rays, you need to protect yourself from direct sun exposure. You should use sunscreen lotion half an hour before gong out in sun. These measures can be followed after first treating the current problem. For this you will have to continue the treatment as prescribed by your doctor. Steroids should not be discontinued abruptly. They should be slowly tapered off over period of time.

560,"Over the course of 2 weeks I have noticed that the foreskin around my penis was feeling a bit itchy. In the progression of the last 2 weeks I have noticed that there is a band like ring around the foreskin of my penis that is dry and feels kind of scaly. When I bath the itching sensation will go away for a while, but will usually begin again by the next day. As to also mention I always keep the area clean and taken care of. The soap I use is hypo allergenic as I do have allergies and monitor them. I currently have no way of going to a doctor to see if it is serious, but I have not had any sexual intercourse in the last 2 months and the last time I did I used proper protection. I am 28 years old, male of course. I have had no change in diet, or medication use. I am prescribed Lorcet pain killers for a ruptured disk and nerve damage from a work related accident over the past 5 years I have been on this. Other than an itching sensation it is causing me no other problems, other than being annoying. I am not sure if its a yeast infection or the dry skin disorder  I believe its called cyroicisis, please excuse the spelling error. I know my father does have this condition on his arms and feet. But any feedback would be welcomed.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I can certainly understand your concern. I have worked through your query in detail. As per your symptoms, the possibility of fungal infection of penis is Va high. Fungal infection is known to cause frequent itching and red blotches that can be quite resistant to treatment. This could be unrelated to sexual activity sometimes and can develop in singular status. Sometimes inadequate hygiene of the undergarments may lead to retention if moisture, that can lead to itching. The painkillers related to nerve and disc pain have no association with this pain. A short course of oral and topical antibiotics (antifungal) will help to improve your symptoms and reduce the itching. Please check with your physician if he shares my view and if you can prescribe these medications to you. A 2-week course is extremely effective to prevent your symptoms. Post your further queries if any. Thank you",1,antibiotics

It sounds like you have developed chronic sinusitis, or chronic allergic rhinitis. This is a constant inflammation of your nasal passages. The initial sneezing may have been signs of hypersensitivity of the nasal passages, but things appear to have progressed so that the lining of your nasal passages are permanently inflamed interfering with Chat Doctor.  People that suffer with this condition often complain of feeling clogged up with fullness around the face and throbbing headaches, especially if they look down at their feet.

Since the reaction was so severe, you may want to consider allergy testing by your doctor. This can be in the form of blood tests or skin tests. They can check for a large range of allergies. When a person is exposed to some agent, they may not show an initial allergic response but as they are continually exposed and sensitized to it, allergies develop. I hope this helps",1,None

Are others around presenting with same symptoms? Is it the first time you are experiencing this? Any fever or lymph node enlargement? A careful evaluation could really be needed. A food allergy is a possibility, but the spread is really unusual. It should be interesting to know the duration of time between consuming alcohol or pee nuts and developing the rash. If it occurred immediately after, it could be incriminated. But if not, other sources should be searched for. Characteristic lesion should easily guide the clinician, depending on whether the rashes are vesicles, pustules, males or pa pules and other clinical parameters, an appropriate diagnosis could easily be made. Booking an appointment with your family physician or dermatologist could be of interest. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD.",1,"peanut, alcohol, nut"

But the positive side was that I noticed how my mood and my emotional state had just changed after 2 days. I was much more happier the second day that i took Venlafaxine. I must tell you that a few years ago; when I was 45, I had gone through a little slight depression so i went to see a doctor and he prescribed citalopram during the day; and Zoplicone for night time and that medication really helped me overcome my depression back then. But this time; I think I waited too long to seek help and I feel I m in a deeper depression more than I know. I totally almost stopped talking and I have always been such a great communicator; I used to have a lot of friends; but my husband is very satisfied with being by himself and he s a little bit of a loner and his job actually doesn t permit him much for socializing; too tired to now that he s getting older. I loved people, and I still do; but i dont feel that I have anything to offer anybody at this time; I feel confused, tired, empty and lonely inside; and I feel that I m sheltering myself; and I feel a lot of anxiety because I know that I m not me right now; The doctor that prescribed me to take Venlafaxine just recently is very young; but she said she s been practicing for 7 years; and I think she s qualified to help me; but I m suppose to go for blood work actually this last week; but I plan to go for sure after Thanks giving. I tried to get a whole of my physician today; but she wasn t around. I was thinking I should talk to a Pharmasist to see if he can offer me some advice about what I should do from here. Can you give me some expert advice on how to deal with myself. Also, I d like to mention that I had a family funeral to attend today; and I didn t take the medication; and I could honestly say that I was very alert for driving, but at the memorial service; I knew people their even my own immediate family; and I didn t know how to truly connect with them. Me was their, but not the 100% me. It was my sister s husband s mother who passed away due to a long battle of cancer. She was a very courageous woman; and it was very emotional for everyone; and I had become very close to her also given the little bit of time that I ve known her. She was an angel in disguise;she was a very strongminded, courageous loving,and caring beautiful person inside and out. So it was a very energy draining, emotional day today for a lot of us.Ok I would like to know if I should continue taking the medication which is Venlafaxine and is it better to take the medication early during the day, because i was taking it late in the afternoon; because i was worried that i would be too sleepy and I would t be able to get through the day. What should I do ? I did not take the medication yesterday; should i still take it tonight now at this time which is 9","Degree understand your concerns went through your details.

The eye discharge is due to narrowing or blockage of nasolacrimal duct, you need to massage the nasal bone near inner part of eyelids for 1 to 2 minutes 5 times a day, and it will gradually improve in 2 months.

I had a slight cough before that which I just attributed to allergies, but this felt like something else.

However throughout the course of the day my symptoms got worse and the bite seemed to increase in size. It s currently about half the size of a pencil eraser, and it s got a white potentially pus-filed center, with a tiny dot (puncture wound?) in the center. It s no longer itchy but the bite is incredibly tender and slightly swollen, and surrounded by a red halo about an inch in diameter.

592,"Hi there -- I had went to a clinic three weeks ago with a tight throat complaint. They had given me antibiotics as strep test came up negative. I went yesterday because I ve had swollen lymph nodes under and behind my jaw and an increasing array of new allergies (I think that s what they are) popping up. This time they subscribed 5 days allergy meds (zyrtec) and if not to go to antibiotics again. I had been taking benadryl before the recent trip and the doctor said it s not enough or not right for my situation.

You may want to have a probiotic supplement like yogurt or Yakut to correct that. Swollen lymph nodes along with hypersensitivity(Allergies) may be due to a viral infection that cannot be cured by antibiotics.

As you have gone through every possible testing and her cough showed no response to even steroids, the possibilities like chronic aspiration and HERD should be considered - Deletion fluoroscopy and esophageal manometry would help.  2. A repeat CT thorax and PET scan would also help to find out any occult node compressing remote areas of bronchi, causing cough. 3. Mild pleurisy which is easily missed by conventional imaging can also be made out by these and hopefully throw some light into the diagnosis.4.

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that your son had an allergic reaction to the antibiotic given to you leading to rashes and swelling. It is one of the common presentation of allergy to antibiotic that leads to rashes and swelling. Many a time there is a delayed allergic reaction as the antibodies against a specific allergen are gradually formed in the body and once they are sufficient in concentration they try to fight against the allergen leading to the symptoms. You should also immediately give him the antibiotics and consult your treating physician and get evaluated, and he can give him anti allergic like Ben Chat Doctor. . Doing cool compresses and applying Calamine lotion can also help. Give plenty of water to wean off the effect of the allergen faster by increasing the excretion through urine.

( She has never previously had allergies to nuts)This morning she woke up with a golf ball sized lump near her belly button.  It appeared blistered and quite sore to touch.She is 36 years of age and 170cm tall. 54kg,"DEAR, Good Evening, Thanks for the query. I studied it in details and understood your health concerns regarding it. Sore, blistered lump at around belly button-is due to the ?boil infected due to the scratching last night ? Could be precipitated by nut allergy. Hope this would help you to plan your treatment with your doctor. Wellcome for any further query in this regard. Wishing you good health. Good Night.

616,"My daughter is almost 3 months old and I am breastfeeding. Yesterday afternoon she developed an itchy rash on her head, neck, chest and back. Several hours later I noticed it had spread to the inside of her arms. The rash resembled hives as the red areas were raised and irregularly shaped. She did not have a fever. Could the rash be an allergic reaction to something that I ate? I have not changed any detergents/soaps. The only new thing was that I ate some strawberries the about 6 hours before her rash developed. Thank you.","Hi, Sudden onset of raised, red and itchy rash over body indicates an acute urticaria. This can be a manifestation of allergy to some insult (but unlikely to your diet), a viral illness or to an infection somewhere in the body. But, since she does not have fever or other symptoms now, we need not worry. Just apply calamine lotion over the lesions 2 times a day for 3-5 days. If it is not coming down by then, or if she develops fever, kindly take to her to pediatrician, as this will need antihistamines and steroids for few days along with treatment of any infection. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.",1,None

Regarding your query for possible allergen in your allergic problem I would like to say that there is possibility of the filling material in your teeth may be allergic to you but if after root canal treatment it is not giving any allergic inflammation at concerned gum than one cant be sure about its allergic nature. To confirm this you may do-1- Skin test for allergy and asked the person concerned about this suspicion.2- Consult your dentist for removal of this filling material and refill with some other inner material and see the effect.

Repeated episodes of wheezing is a symptom of asthma. Asthma refers to reversible obstruction of the air passages. There are different triggers that can cause an attack to occur. It would also cause coughing and breathlessness. It is very important that you visit a doctor who can evaluate you for this condition.

If you continue to use it despite your allergy, the allergic response would progressively worsen. If you are accidentally exposed, then the use of oral anti histamines would help. As a person is repeatedly exposed to a particular substance, it is possible to build an allergic response to it. This is what happened in your case. I hope this helps",1,chicken

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. Although there are so many types of rashes, I guess you may be having chronic urticaria. Chronic urticaria have so many causes. Common ones are physical ones - excessive sweating, exposure to warmth/cold, physical activity, sun exposure, pressure over some part of body, etc. If these are not the causes, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who may advise you some investigations like CBC, ESR, CRP, thyroid function, thyroid antibodies, urine & stool examination, allergy testing, etc. This will help him to reach at some diagnosis and suggest treatment accordingly. Till then, I would suggest you to take a Chat Doctor. Regarding blood sugar, it is very unusual for ALEX to cause elevation of blood sugar. This might be a chance finding. Please do not worry if your one time blood sugar report is high, I would suggest you to get fasting blood sugar, postprandial blood sugar & HbA1C reports which will help to know what is abnormal with your sugar levels and whether you are really diabetic or not.

The allergens like dust, food, pollen and mites will stimulate the mast cells to release histamine which is the marker of allergy and produces these weird symptoms of generalized hives.

Once the rhinitis goes beyond control and affects the airways, you develop breathing difficulties as in asthma. That the CBC is normal, suggests the eosinophil count is also normal, that would exclude severe allergies. However, house dust mite or fungal allergies are common at this time of the year. I would suggest long-acting antihistamines like cetirizine 10\u00a0mg (maximum twice daily) and/or a nasal spray like Flonase 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 1 month and see the benefit.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. Childhood asthma can be present at this age, especially when there is family history of asthma. If your child has recurrent wheezing episodes, requires nebulization, nighttime cough, symptoms associated with seasonal changes, I would first think of asthma. Asthma can be allergic and non-allergic. The investigations suggested by your doctor will help, but if they are negative, it will not mean your daughter has no allergy/asthma. There is not a single test to diagnose asthma at this age. Detailed asking of symptoms and pattern of symptoms only will suggest asthma. However, there are tests available for diagnosis of allergy, I would additionally suggest allergy testing and serum IGE levels for allergy. Hope this will be helpful to you.

Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of chronic cough which is due to upper respiratory track infection leading to bronchitis/ granular pharyngitis.

If symptoms keeps on persisting you should consult ENT specialist and take proper treatment. You should get X-ray chest done along with pulmonary function tests.

The simple answer is no. Whether she might be allergic to some food or formula ingredient - I cannot say yes or no with confidence.

After all that I had to go back to my doctor because she say I was about to get the gingivitis disease in my mouth it was the thrush on my tongue then she changed my allergies med from tavist to Claritin with the nasal drip and a high antibiotic name Cleocin which helped out and diflucan for yeast infection. Through it all my lymph nodes don t swell but they still irritate and I m wondering what is the next step I need to take,"Hi, thanks for sharing your health concerns with Chat Doctor!I've gone through your situation and can perceive the magnitude of concerns building within you! Did you do any test from the collection within the lymph nodes? If yes, then please mention the pathological reports; If not please do an FNAC test with AFB/Fungal smears also; this is necessary for a definitive diagnosis and to plan the line of treatment! As per your description, there is high chance of contagious infection from teeth/gingival etc., but still it could be tuberculosis or some independent pathology of the lymph node itself! Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.",1,antibiotic

Not sure how to get rid of it as my little daughther is sufferiing a lot since a quite long time. Your advice is highly appreciated.,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of asthma is more likely. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. She will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti-allergic (montelukast) once a day at night is also beneficial.Don't worry, she will be alright.

I did everything I was told to do, but the swelling is still there, though not nearly like it was. I have had what I thought was fluid on my knee since shortly after the surgery, but I was told the swelling would go down. I went in for the yearly checkup and was told the swelling could be scar tissue . When I disagreed with the doctor, he said that it was fluid that needed to be drained. He aspirated it, sent the synovial fluid to the lab, and told me there was no infection, but that he suspected rheumatoid arthritis . I went to a rheumatologist who told me there was no RA, but very possibly I was experiencing an allergic reaction to the components of the implant. I was not given any information at all about the implant that I received. I called the OS and was told that they don t even keep that info in my file there at their office, and the MA, I felt, proceeded to send me on the proverbial wild goose chase. I suspect, after doing a lot of research, that I could be having a reaction to the metal. How do I find out exactly what implant was used in my knee?

The surgery that was expected to make your life better did not actually turn out to be so.  However, you need to look the life before and after surgery.  You describe everything after surgery and how your knee should have been and how you should have walked, etc.,  However, you do not mention what you expectations were and how your life or your problem knee was before surgery.  It is very possible to feel depressed, however you need to reconcile with the fact that the surgery and the consequent improvement is gradual, and it should have been alluded to by your surgeon.

I am still itchy","Hello, Itching with elevated bilirubin may suggest that there is an obstruction in bile flow that most commonly occurs with gall bladder pathologies, and is usually gall stones. A detailed liver function test (LFT) would have helped to secure this diagnosis if the alkaline phosphatase was also raised. But as you mentioned no obvious jaundice, it is important to know that the other LFT parameters such as the enzymes are normal. An ultrasound liver/GB is important at this stage. Antihistamine will lower the itch but if this liver/GB related itch you will need medications like cholestyramine that should be prescribed after a visit/consultation with a gastroenterologist.

Within 30 minutes of lying on bed she will coough and there will be intermittent cough. It got intensified. When we saw the doctor next day, he told us that it could be allergic rhinitis or asthma and would go away as the nasal passage becomes big/as she grows big  and several medicines were suggested. I dont remember them now but most of them were syrups. She also started to weeze  after running for awhile.After two yrs he suggested Montek LC one tab every day and  Levolin inhaler in case of chest tightness.  After this  she has been sleeping well, looked normal  and as per the doictors advice we started withdrawing Montek LC.  But in two days  all the symptoms are back.  In the middle of the night she gets up  and cough and her chest becomes tight & could not breathe. We had to give her 3 to 4 times Levolin inhaler some days.

I can understand your concerns. You are having Urticaria and angioedema. Causative allergens can be food as well as non-food protein. You can undergo serum IGE level & absolute eosinophil count. You can take H\u2081 antihistamines non-sedating agents such as loratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine, or low-sedating agents such as cetirizine or levocetirizine. The addition of an H\u2082 antagonist such as sanitizing in conventional dosages may add benefit. A CysLT1 receptor antagonist such as montelukast, 10 mg/day also can be added. You have to continue for a longer period, as it may be seasonal. A short course of oral steroid (e.g. Deflazacort 6 mg daily orally for 7-10 days) helps in urticaria with eosinophil prominence, idiopathic angioedema with or without urticaria, or chronic urticaria that responds poorly to conventional treatment.",1,egg

Should I discount ue wheat cereal and give only rice. She does not like gerber cereal.","Hi! Thank you for consulting with Chat Doctor ! Is the rashes just on her right cheek? Have you noticed rashes on other parts of her body? Babies have very sensitive skin. It can be that she always sleeps on the right side and this part of the face is always in contact with the bedsheet or the cloth where she sleeps. It is best to avoid strong scents like perfumes, lotions and powder for both babies and caregivers. Also, when you start feeding the baby, introduce food one at a time. Give one kind of food for 3 days before introducing a new food to her. In that way you can observe if she has any reaction to that particular food. For example give wheat cereals for 3 days. Observe if she has a reaction like rashes, swollen eyes or in worst cases difficulty of breathing. If none, you may give mashed vegetable like potato for the next 3 days. Again observe for a reaction. If none, then you know she can eat wheat cereals and potato. Then again you can add another kind. Hope I was able to answer your question. Have a good day!

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. Bronchitis can cause coughing with breathing difficulty. Usually cough is not subsided by routine cough suppressant. For this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out other lung diseases. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease.

Originally after I recieved the sting, I became really light headed but didnt think too much of it.

The symptoms described by you are not due to major allergic reactions and likely to subside by a day. In case of increasing symptoms you may have to take antihistamines medication. If there is pain analgesic like NSAIDs will help. In severe anaphylactic cases there may be a need of administration of a Chat Doctor.

The kit that you have prescribed is an Oral antifungal i.e. fluconazoleClotrimazole vaginal tablets may not be completely effective in a vaginal fungal infection. Oral antifungals are faster acting and therefore preferred. Single dose of an Oral antifungal is recommended for vaginal candida infections and is sufficient in eradicating the infection and that is the reason that you were given just one dose.

784,"Ive been having seasonal allergies and my doctor told me that they have been making me cough for the first time ever.  It started about 2 weeks ago.  3 days ago I started on an inhaler and Tessalon for the cough.  It was helping when I was at home for Monday and Tuesday.  I came to work Wednesday and the office that is under construction in our building was painting.  Our building doesnt have windows that open, so the paint fumes were flowing through the ventilation system.  Now my cough is just as bad as it was without the inhaler and Tessalon.  And in addition Ive had a headache and my body hurts since leaving early yesterday, and I felt nauseated most of the day yesterday.  Could these new issues be from the paint fumes?  I also just realized the construction started about 2-3 weeks ago.  Could the cough be related to the construction?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. A construction site has lots more irritants like paint fumes, various types of dust particles, sometimes fuel smokes, etc. Most of them are actually not allergens, they do not cause allergies. But they are irritants. When one inhales them, they cause irritation of respiratory mucous membranes. This causes various respiratory symptoms like sneezing, nasal obstruction, cough, breathing difficulty, etc. So it is possible that cough could be related to the construction.

During sleep this blood would be collected in throat and coughed out on waking up. Probably you are having bacterial or fungal infection of the sinuses (paranasal sinuses) on left side. It is causing pain on left eye, nose, forehead. You will require treatment with antibiotics and nasal Chat Doctor. The disease can be confirmed by proper examination of nasal cavity, by X-ray of sinuses, or by nasal endoscopy. Sometimes CT scan of sinuses will be required.

Recurrent sneezing attacks can also make one feel giddy. Disturbed sleep due to dust mite allergy can also lead to several non-specific symptoms. If the neurologist and chest physicians have not found anything alarming, I would suggest you get either blood tests (specific IGE) or skin test that would reveal your allergies and according start the treatment. Smoking can lead to restricted lung volumes with air trapping known as chronic obstructive airways' disease for which several inhalers are available. For allergy treatment, combined use of oral antihistamines and nasal sprays will help overcome the symptoms but should be used continuously for at least 2 months or longer depending on the sensitization profile.

My grandfather had it mildly all over, my father, very severe and in big patches on his lower legs, arms, trunk and face apart from the scalp. He used to scratch till blood oozed out.I had Psorises, all over me suddenly in span of a couple of months, starting from a small patch on the outside of the elbow. We used a emuslion made from COCONUT SHELLS, I dont remember about it. It used to flareup every 2 or 3 years an random season. Never took any medication, but applied plenty of White Grease, and a solution of Solid Tar (The ONE USED for making Roads in the seventies with BENZENE.My father prohibited me from touching any patch.I used to clench my fist so tight that my nails dug into the palms and only applied the above medications. I ensured that I never have upset stomach--loose motion or constipation, drink 2 or3 liters of water, plenty of liver in diet apart from fish and chicken, and curd. Consequently in time, the itchy sensation  subsided and I came at peace with myself.The flaring up of Psorises was random and not linked with any season, The quoting of grease made summers difficult as I had a field job travelling 20 days plus, in a month. Exposure to sun and dust worsened the situation.Then in earsy ninetees Psorises took pity on me, or let us say I learnt to live with it and round then I came in touch with a Homeopath.

Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor Psoriasis has a chronic remitting and relapsing course. It may involve only isolated areas like scalp, palms, soles, elbow, knee etc. Or may spread to involve vast segments of the body. Psoriasis is a steroids responsive skin condition. Topical steroids are first line treatments in limited involvement with psoriasis. As your disease has largely remained localized to a limited area on your hairline at the forehead and behind the ear, therefore, I would suggest you to use a topical steroid lotion with or without salicylic acid, twice daily at the scalp skin. You may was the scalp with a coal tar and salicylic acid based shampoo, daily or every alternate days. These together would be good enough for your localized psoriasis. Topical steroid lotions and coal tar based shampoos are prescription products, therefore, I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your vicinity for a review of your skin condition and appropriate prescription.

I am from india, Aged 24. Thank you","Hello and welcome. Thank you for your query. The food you have mentioned could very well be the allergen (cause of the allergic reaction). Seafood is a very common allergen, so is oil, which you would have fried your cutlets in. I would request you to notice anything different that you have consumed, may be a new brand of oil, or different source of meat, and if this food was consumed from an eatery outside, I would advise you to avoid the particular joint in the future. The description of your rash, does match that of an allergic rash, but there are many more rashes that do still match your current presentation as well. I would advise you to visit any physician, and show him the rash, as a rash has to almost always be inspected by a physician or dermatologist before prescribing treatment. I am from India too, and as we have the privilege of having many clinics, in almost every nook and corner of our Indian streets, consulting any one of these doctors should help you, as they can help give you immediate relief from your problem.

We have gone to a dertmatoligist and she has diagnosed Pityriasis Rosea. 2 Questions, I have done research online and only found 1 study showing that it increases the risk of miscarriage and may cause mobility issues or strength issues in the muscles as an infant that can be overcome. Are there any other more concrete studies showing the effects of this and what is your experience with this virus amongst pregnant women? The second question is what are the differences in symptoms of Pityriasis Rosea and PUPPP?","Hello there, thanks for your query. Your efforts in researching for scientific literature is commendable. As you have rightly found out there are not many studies regarding satyriasis rose in pregnancy. Those reports suggest possible miscarriage, premature delivery, movement issues in the baby. It is very difficult to Chat Doctor.  What one can do in such a circumstance is adopted a wait and watch policy and take adequate precautions to prevent miscarriage and preterm delivery.

It spares face, feet and palms. Whereas puppy is seen in the last trimester of pregnancy and seen as pa pules along lines of striae over abdomen and thighs, and it gets intensely itchy. It is most likely related to stretching of the skin. I would like to add that I have given gross features of PR, and it should not be used to diagnose the lesion by oneself. Satyriasis rose should be diagnosed by a trained dermatologist who does job at their best and the management in pregnancy should be a team work comprising your obstetrician and dermatologist and a good radiologist.

Psoriasis is caused by genetic and autoimmune factors.  Stress can aggravate psoriasis. Keeping the stress levels low is key to treatment of psoriasis. Effective oral and topical medications are now available for Psoriasis. Psoriasis can be kept under control and patient can have long-standing remissions free of psoriasis skin lesions. My advice to you would be to use topical steroid with good moisturizer.  Few treatments like PVA therapy and phototherapy can help to treat psoriasis effectively. Consult a good dermatologist who can provide you with these options along with effective oral prescription medicines. Remember psoriasis can be controlled very effectively but cannot be completely cured. Hope this helps. Regards Chat Doctor.",1,drug

As you have mentioned your complaints are basically hypersensitive and autoimmune by nature. this kind of problems are caused by altered sensitivity and susceptibility to the environment (may in external or internal). Being a homeopath what I can say is that homeopathy is most probably more suitable to treat such condition as it treats the person, and not the disease. As you have taken Homeopathy in past there may be 2 things, 1) As psoriasis is being known for its recurrence, it may have come back but this time in less intensity and in less area of your body. 2) your homeopath needs to rework on your case, make fresh case taking and see how things unfold.

And when you scratch and get red raised lesion that is called \""symptomatic demographic\"". Along with allergy it can be triggered by any infection in the body like infestation of worms in the stomach, bacterial infection in teeth or any fungal infection on body. Even food items which you are allergic to can cause such kind of lesions. Stool examination is to see if you have any worms in the stool. In such cases better is to deform the patient by giving him albendazole tablets. Along with this you would also require a long course of anti-allergic medicines, since it is difficult to find the exact cause of allergy. You should also rule any tooth decay and thyroid problem. It is at times associated with thyroid disease. Couple ways to find out the allergen is - PRICK TEST & secondly immunological testing where in all food items are tested. So, consult your dermatologist with this background. I hope this would help you to understand your disease better. Regards, Chat Doctor.",1,fish

856,"Hi I ve been having the following problem since I was 18 (I m currently 29). This is a little long, sorry.Maybe once or twice a month sometimes even more rarely I would suddenly without much of any warning feel an intense feeling of impending doom. Very pronounced, an extreme sensation like I was about to die, and thoughts of impending doom. Difficult to describe the sensation other than that it comes along with an extreme feeling of anxiety. Then within about 2-4 minutes after having this sensation I would pass out. I don t ever remember passing out. My father once saw me when this happened and he said I stand up straight and then slump down to the ground. After I wake up which I think is usually almost immediately or a few minutes after losing consciousness I feel intensely sick, like I m about to die. I have temporary amnesia. I don t know who or what I am or where I am, and I usually can t see for a few minutes. This memory loss goes away in a few minutes as well as my ability to see. The other very apparent symptom is intense and sudden sweating. I m literary drenched with sweat. Also, I feel incredibly weak, slightly nauseous and intensely sick like I am dieing. I can t even get off the floor. Eventually these feeling fade within about 30-40 minutes after which time I feel still very sick but have enough energy to stand up. Then it might take 1-2 hours to feel normal again although sometimes when I have a really bad attack it can take 24 hours before I feel normal again. I ve seen a few doctors for this and one doctor said he thinks it was syncope. The other doctors just ran quite a few tests said their results were normal and never really got back to me. It didn t seem like they really new what was going on. I ve had ecocardiograms done and mri, botChatDoctore back normal. I ended up just living with it for some several years until when I was about 27 one day for no real reason I bought some raw barley that I saw in the supermarket. It was just an impulse buy as I never noticed it before and thought it would be interesting to cook it like rice. I liked it a lot, but that day I became intensely sick maybe several hours after eating it. I had extreme diarrhea, repeated vomiting, and a general feeling of being sick. At the time I thought I had a stomach virus so I thought I would just stay at home and rest, but it kept getting worse and worse so I went to the doctor. The doctor thought I might have a stomach parasite since one of the blood tests indicated elevated eosinophil count but the stool test showed no parasite. She sent me to a hematologist, who ran more blood tests which showed nothing wrong and the eosinophil count dropping down to normal. By that time I was feeling better. That doctor just recommended contacting him again if symptoms return. They didn t for a long time until after several months I decided to finish eating the rest of the barley I had. The same symptoms returned. I haven t asked any doctor about it since but was just assuming that it was some strange allergic reaction. At about that same time I began noticing that I was beginning to feeling slightly itchy whenever I at spicy foods which I ate alot. I decided to stop eating barley and spicy foods and I noticed that my fainting spells stopped. I hadn t eaten spicy foods for a year and I haven t fainted since. About a year ago I decided to try to test it out for sure so I ate spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce and a few days later I had a fainting episode with the same symptoms. I assumed it was an allergic reaction and after having read a bit more I was assuming that all the time I was going into anaphylaxis. The only two symptoms I don t seem to have is swelling of my throat and hands as well as any rash or itching. The itching comes immediately after eating spicy foods and the anaphylaxis maybe a few days or several hours later. My question is the following, is this the likely diagnosis? And is there a simple definitive test to diagnose this? What type of doctor should I see? I ve also noticed a few years ago that I seem to also be allergic to tylenol after never having been before. I had pretty standard allergic reaction symptoms. My lips swelled up, I felt itchy, and difficulty breathing. It lasted for only a few minutes and went away. Since then I have been staying clear of barley, cayenne pepper, and tylenol and it seems to work although I haven t seen a doctor about this allergic reaction guess for my past problems. The reason why I am asking now is because a few days ago I stupidly ate something with cayenne pepper in it and had another fainting spell without having had any problems for a long time. I noticed that the symptoms were the same but extremely intense this time around and a few hours later I noticed that my right eye felt itchy. When I rubbed it slightly I felt a sudden burning sensation that quickly went away. I immediately rushed to the bathroom mirror and noticed that the skin surrounding my eye was pitch black, as if I had a really bad black eye. I don t remember having hit my face as my face didn t feel sore after i fainted. The after affects after the faint lasted all day this time and out of curiosity I took my temperature and it read 95.2 degrees F (oral). Thinking this low I decided to have a hot bath. After sitting in the bath for about a few minutes the nausea suddenly intensified and I spontaneously began to vomit multiple times. For some reason the bath made me really sick. Anyway I m committed to stay clear of cayenne pepper and be more careful in the future, but the reason why I wanted to ask a doctor about this now was because I wanted to know if you think I should have an epipen on hand. I was a little afraid as to how much more intense the symptoms were after having not had them for so long. I was wondering if you think I should get checked out again or if there is really no way to definitively confirm such an allergy. Also, from what I read barley, cayenne pepper, and tylenol allergies are rare and also I don t experience every common allergy symptom. So I was wondering if you think I was wrong about this being an allergy or if this is indicative of some other type of unusual condition. I just didn t want to waste my time and money seeing another doctor about this again since I wasn t sure if there was going to be anything also they could test or do for me other than to advice staying clear of those foods for which I already know.","Hi...thanks for using Chat Doctor .I have noticed two problems in you...one panic disorder which lead to anxiety symptoms and second allergy to barley, Tylenol and cayenne pepper.

865,"Two months ago I had very low energy (not usual for me). I also had a continual dry cough. Doctor said my air flow was not good, gave me a Cortisone shot and said I may have asthma so put me on inhaler. Then both my legs became weak to the point that if I bent down I could barely get up. Next morning, my arms were weak down to my fingers. Still dry cough. Had a chest xray. Was told I had emphysema. (I smoked when I was twenty for about 4 years. I am 67 now). I was given another inhaler with cortisone. No explanation for my muscle weakness which did get better at times to where it was almost gone. The dry cough remained so I did a Pulmonary function test. 80% is the norm for my age etc. I scored 98 on intake, 91 on initial blow out but 65% on the in between blowing out. After inhaler, I scored the same on intake and blow out but improve to 75% in middle range. So, I have been using inhalers and some days I am a little better some days especially at work (office job) I get worse. Went to Allergist, no allergies. He suggested that the increase in my raspy voice and coughing could be from one of the inhalers and gave me a different one to use. He also suggested that I see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist. That was yesterday. I used the new inhaler and it seems not to irritate my throat as much. However, I can hardly move my legs are so weak. Arms are stiff, neck is stiff and now my jaw is stiff. My doctor has not returned my call. I am getting worried. I am a very healthy person, energetic, not overweight, no high bp, no high cholesteral. I eat healthy and stay active and am rarely sick.

I appreciate any help.","If you had emphysema earlier and also taking treatment for that, you can continue the treatment, and also you were a chain smoker in the past. The most possible reason of your Chat Doctor. You have already undergone pulmonary function tests, but you should also do complete blood count with X-ray chest. You will require high antibiotics (quinolones or cephalosporins or amaryllis with clavulanic acid) for at least 7 to 10 days with antiallergic like steroids, antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers etc. with saline nebulizers and steam inhalation.

In my opinion you should consult him to pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out Bronchial asthma. Possibility of asthma is high in his case because of following reasons.1. Raised IGE level (allergic disease)2. Presence of lung spasm.3. Recurrent symptoms. So better to first diagnose him and then start treatment accordingly. Asthma is manageable disease by inhaled bronchodilators. Home remedies are not helpful in this disease. If food allergy is present than he should avoid taking particular food. But inhaled bronchodilators are must if he found to have asthma.

The treatment is long term use of nasal corticosteroids plus or minus oral antihistamines (although of limited benefit). The nasal corticosteroid recommended is mometasone furnace 1 spray per nostril once daily (start with twice daily for a month). You can also use Elastane spray 1-2 sprays three times a day for bad itching if required. It is a difficult condition to treat completely, and you are not alone. Best Wishes.",1,None

Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor This seems most likely to be a fungal infection of the groin (Tina courts). The location of the rash and itching goes in favor of this being a fungal infection. Groin folds are a common site of fungal infections; the anatomy being such that the folds trap moisture, which is conducive to fungal growth, specially in hot and humid weather of summers. I would suggest you to use an OTC topical antifungal e.g. clotrimazole 1% cream, twice daily. An OTC oral antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily will provide you symptomatic relief from itching. General measures would include bathing twice daily, wearing loose fitting clothes and cotton undergarments. Regards",1,None
875,"my kid of 10 yrs has seasonal allergy leading to endless coughing & increased respiration . so we have to nebulise him 3 times a day.. doctor advised to give montair ic . other doctor said its preventive medicine, it can t be given in this condition. pl. advice","Hi there, I understand your concern, and I would like to assure you that the Montage is appropriate for him at this time.  Montage, or montelukast can be taken for allergies and asthma both as a relief and maintenance therapy.  It all depends on how long he will be exposed to the allergens.  In fact, it would suit him if it is very clearly a seasonal type allergy, because then he can take it throughout the pollen season, and stop it the rest of the year. What the other doctor means is that it is not appropriate for immediate rescue the way a nebulizer can be used, because it takes a few hours to even be absorbed.  If your son is very breathless, it probably will not work fast enough, much like how an antihistamine is not meant to stop the allergy immediately. You should find that adding on Montage will make him need the nebulizer less frequently, because it brings down the general level of allergic reaction in the body.  I will repeat that it is not meant to replace the nebulizer, which is a short term rescue solution when he is breathless.  Hopefully, just decreasing the need for nebulizers will make his allergy more manageable through the season. Hope this helps, and all the best to you.",1,pollen

There are different causes but based on the fact that your symptoms occur with certain positions then it may be caused by BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). This is a condition of the inner ear, and it is not related to your allergies. Your doctor can confirm this by performing certain maneuvers in his or her office. Treatment would involve your doctor taking you through other maneuvers (called EPLE maneuver) to correct the issues in the inner ear causing the problem. I hope this helps",1,None

897,"My husband began taking blood pressure meds (amlodipine and benzepril) and antidepressants (Celexa) about 5 yrs ago (age 40). He has over that same time developed allergic reactions to vinegar, garlic, rosemary, and tree nuts. If he even touches these things he has trouble breathing and develops itching or hives. He even found he couldnt do wood working with walnut wood. Allergy testing does not show immune system response, so these are anaphylactoid not anaphylactic. This has gotten to be very debilitating as standard allergy meds knock him out for 16-20 hrs. So he cant work. Could the medications be causing the sensitization?","Many academicians have analyzed your type of questions and have generated a lot of information whether this causes allergy. Analyses have not fetched the cure because of diverse opinions and failure to find a solid approach. Only Ayurveda has the answer by orally taking safe herbals over some months or even more than a year and find enhanced immunity to prevent such allergens from making a reaction in your body. But it's not less than a feat to gulp pure herbals being unpalatable in taste, coarse looking and reminding of pre-historic era. Who cares about scientific sanctity of such herbs.

I have been stung many times in the past, by all types of insects, and I had never had a reaction.  This time, I puffed up like a blowfish, had welts all over my body, and my breathing became very constricted and labored.  I immediately went to the hospital and was discharged a few hours later.  A couple of months later, I was tested for bee/vespid allergens and everything came up negative.

Just today, I was stung again while cutting the grass.  I am not sure by what type of bee or vespid.

In my opinion you are having viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and due to this worsening of underlying bronchitis and asthma. Viral infection is known risk factor for worsening of underlying asthma/bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT is needed to diagnose asthma and bronchitis. It also tells about severity. And treatment is depending on severity only. So you may require inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamines.

As allergy has already ruled out, other possible causes are sinus problem or vasomotor rhinitis. Consult ENT doctor for examination, Nasal endoscopy is useful to check for sinus, once sinus problem is ruled out, other probable cause is vasomotor rhinitis, which is basically due to dilatation of blood vessel in nose causing symptoms. Saline nasal spray, decongestants are useful, If your symptoms are not controlled with these measures then corticosteroid nasal sprays, antihistamine nasal sprays useful. Correction of any deviated septum, if present, is helpful in avoiding recurrence.

Since your mother is hypertensive and asthmatic, there are two possibilities for nighttime coughing in her case.1. Acute left Ventricular failure (LVF)2. Asthma exacerbation. So get done 2D Echo to know her left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). If it is lower than this is the cause for her symptoms. If this is normal than get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If worsening Obstructive defect on PFT, then possibility of asthma exacerbation is more. So consult your doctor and discuss these possibilities with him. Also discuss starting anti-allergic plus antihistamine combination in night. It will give her more relief.",1,None

C. M. Allergy is a very common disease and I would like to say in one word that in modern era at least we can't escape from this disease. Dust, linen, fiber, fine powder, mite pet hairs sudden change in temp (up & down), polluted industrial air are the major causes of allergy. Initial symptoms are, Itch in throat, nose, Tears from the eyes, Sneezing, Common cold (Cory) Stuffy nose, Snot from nose begins watery in consistency and afterwards in thick mucus form, COUGH (later stage due to infection)Breathlessness (later stage) Many patients done agree that they have asthma, but the hard fact is allergy to allergens are a precursor of ASTHMA. The best way is take precautions about these above-mentioned reasons. If, still you have these things than consult a physician and have a treatment of allergy (due to initial phase).

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your wives history. I would like to know more about her symptoms like - What are her symptoms while she consumes milk? Since what age she started having allergy reactions? What is the frequency of these reactions? Does she have any other medical problem? Does she take any regular/frequent Chat Doctor?  Were I treating her, I would suggest her Specific IGE by Immunogen for milk protein or skin prick testing or preferably both for milk allergy. If it is positive, I would suggest her to restrict milk & milk products for at least 6 months. If it is negative, there are high chances she has milk intolerance rather than milk allergy, which is an entirely different condition.2. Not all hives/swelling of body parts are always due to allergies, especially if they are present for more than several months and no clue can be thought of about precipitating factor. In such cases, I usually advise tests like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, ANA, tests for liver, kidney & thyroid function, allergy testing, urine & stool examination, etc. Selection from these tests can only be done after reviewing complete history of the patient. I would also suggest her testing for physical urticaria which is performed by allergists/dermatologists. With these tests, usually diagnosis can be made in 60-70% of the cases, but not in all the cases. Hope above answer will be helpful to you. Should you have any other concern, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your wife the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.",1,milk

939,"Thank you doctor, and I appreciate the quick response. Like stated earlier, I ve always had a fear of the doctors. Whenever something I thought was seriously wrong I always confided in my mom, and she would always reassure me that I would be ok. She was right 100%. Now that she is no longer here, I have nobody to go to, so I appreciate you understanding where I m coming from. Four years ago I was diagnosed with a slight thing of anxiety. My doctor prescribed me alpralozam. The pills expired in 2012. They helped cause they just took the edge off. My grandmother, grandfather, uncle, and mom have passed away within these past 3 years. It s too much to handle all at once. They all went into the hospital, and never made it out, so that s the way my mind thinks. I think if I go into the hospital, that I ll never make it back out. Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but that s how I think. About a month ago I had this slight pain between my thumb and index finger. Again, nothing serious, probably just a bruise, but I took it to the extreme. First thing I did, was search up online if there are glands in your hands. Of course there are, so right away I think it s a swollen gland and something is wrong. I worried about that for a couple days, and must have tensed myself up so bad that my fingers started to ache and hurt. So, right away I start thinking the worse. Why are my hands and fingers hurting now. I worried about that for a week. Sure enough the pain between my thumb and finger, went away. This brings me up to now, where I must ve worried myself so much about my fingers and hands that it cause what I hope is anxiety. About a week after all of this happening, I woke up last Saturday and stood up and felt like I was off balance. Nothing serious, figured it was just allergies. It got better throughout the day, and would come and go. Again, thinking crazy, got it in my head that it was something serious, like a brain tumor, brain hemorage, etc. I would constantly search up symptoms of all those things and worry myself day in and day out. This past Monday, 2 days after this occurred I sucked it up and went to the doctor. She checked me out. My BP was 115/75, my lungs and heart both sounded good. I explained this situation and she said to just relax myself. Once I left that doctors office, I didn t feel a thing. I felt like myself. Sure enough, as time went on, that feeling came back. It sucks and I hate it. That s how this whole past week has been. I wake up, and im fine. As the day goes by, I start worrying that the feeling is going to come back.

This condition is relatively rare because the skin of the scalp tends be thicker than in any other place on the body. Simply avoiding the irritant may be enough for some, while others might require further treatment. Mild cases can be relieved with calamine lotion, which will help soothe the area and relieve itching. Moderate cases may require a prescription for a steroid cream. For serious reaction with oozing and crusting, a wet or damp cloth can be applied directly to the area for immediate relief. If the symptoms are not relived you may have to consult your dermatologist. Thank you.",1,None

955,"For the past month I have severe itching at night, all over my body and head, (no rash). It gets so bad that i have taken benedryl almost every night. It used to just happen only when I was in our den for more than 1/2 hour or when I ate anything with soy lethicin (commonly found in most chocolates). Also itch if I used soap products like Tide. So I stick with the same skin, hair, makeup and cloths washing products. I have recently started taking Solostar Lantus(15u) at night. I have known allergies to dust mites, cinnamon and soy lecithin. I have changed from a feather to a foam pillow. I itch whether I sleep in my own bed or on the sofa.","Dear Madam, From what you described, you have allergies often which cause itches. However, it would be good to rule out causes of itches especially given the fact that this particular itches as you said have been a problem since a month now and at night. Accumulation of certain substances in the body due to their not being able to be excreted can also cause such itches. This is common when the gall bladder which uses bile to excrete toxins from the body has some issues. So kindly see a physician for lab test especially for the gall bladder to rule out other causes other than allergies. Check to see if something AHS changed too in your diet or bed or what you use to ensure It's not simply some allergy. However, it would be good to see a physician to rule out some other cause such as gall bladder malfunction. Hope this helps. Quick recovery and regards, Chat Doctor.",1,"soy, dust"

961,"Hello! My mother aged 78 years who is being suffering from bronchitis allergy for past one decade... two days back she suddenly had short breath with noise while breathing and her foot and ankle are swollen. She has varicose veins.. Doctor have put her on CHESTON DT, DERIPHULLIE SYRUP and ZIFI 200 all twice a day... Her chest x-ray shows as all normal... is she on write medicines? please help me out..","Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your mother. As by history I can understand that your mom is 78 years old, so the Cardiorespiratory endurance will be less. Also, on addition she has asthma, so the respiratory system is weak. She has varicose vein and not the foot and ankle are swollen. To assist further a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. To understand the situation a little knowledge about the conditions is needed. Bronchial Asthma - as you know when people having difficulty in breathing they will consume more energy and feel weaker with fatigue. When there is bronchial Asthma the patient feels weaker to perform any activity due to early fatigue and less oxygen supply. They will have shortness of breath, difficulty in doing deep breathing. Varicose veins - this is like the clots obstructing the normal venous return and led to high blood pressure. As sometimes this leads to swelling as well. Age - as she is 78, she will have slow metabolism and the vascular system will also be slow which may lead to insufficient flow of blood to various organs of the body including the brain. In my clinical practice I deal with geriatrics range between 79-107 years of age. I have a strong recommendation for them to perform exercises. The exercises are divided into various forms. For your mothers initial complain of swelling in ankle and feet I will advise to elevate the feet and perform ankle toe movements. As it will improve the venous return and reduce the swelling & pain. Also, for asthma I will advise doing regular breathing exercises. These include the following -* deep breathing exercises* pursed lip breathing exercises* diaphragmatic breathing exercises* costal breathing exercises* abdominal breathing exercise. For the aging factor - general body exercises to improve the metabolism and immune system. By doing regular general exercises the vascular system Improves and also the blood supply to different organs which helps the other organs nourish. Also, aging demands a physical exercise, but each case has different way to deal and get helped. In aging the pain levels are not bearable and also due to lack of exercise the muscles and joints become painful. Exercise will also improve the blood supply, breathing ability, functional Mobility etc. My geriatrics patients recover in 4-8 weeks of time and prolong the therapy as long as they can perform. As by doing regular physical therapy exercise they live healthy and mobile.regards Jay In Chat Doctor.",1,None

In my opinion it seems to be due to bed bug or mosquito bite or an associated allergic reaction to it. Bedbugs are most active at night. They may bite any exposed areas of skin while an individual is sleeping. Common locations for bedbug bites are the face, neck, hands, and arms. A bedbug bite is painless and is generally not noticed. The bites may be mistaken for a rash of another cause. Small, flat, or raised bumps on the skin are the most common sign. Symptoms include redness, swelling, and itching. Typically, no treatment is required for bedbug bites. If itching is severe, steroid creams or oral antihistamines may be used for symptom relief.",1,"mosquito, chicken"

I was concerned over my recent symptoms (Shortness of breath, dry cough, extreme fatigue, headaches, hoarseness of voice.) and a ER doctor performed a X-Ray on me. X-Ray came out just fine. They asked me the basic medical questions. They discharged me assuming that I had chest inflammation and prescribed me ibuprofen. That went horribly. It didn t help my symptoms at all. Went to the Walk-in GP. I was told I was having a allergic reaction... I asked for a MRI to address the concerns it could be Lung Cancer (I will explain my reasons as to why below) but I was denied due to the person currently seeing me being a Nurse. I was sent home there. Also, I do not have Pneumonia or any sort of flu or cold. The reason why I believe it s Lung Cancer is because I am not very active and recent reports suggest that theres a %6 percent chance of obtaining Lung cancer if you sit for more then 6 hours and being around secondhand smokers (which I am alot, due to my family being a very active smoking family) increases the risk by %30-40 percent. Can you help me some how?","Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. First, no need to worry at all for lung cancer as it is extremely uncommon at your age (14 years). In my opinion you are having either asthma or bronchitis.  As second hand smoke can cause both of the above. And coughing with breathing difficulty are seen in both. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test). This will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamine Chat Doctor.

I am wondering if it may be palm oil","Hello. Food allergy can be due to anything. Personally the most practical way to identify the food causing allergy is to keep a food diary. I would suggest you to keep a note of each and every food your daughter consumes with time and date and also note the time and date of symptoms. Please note ingredients of each food items too. Your keen observation will help you to identify the food causing allergic symptoms. I would like to let you know that most common foods causing allergy are - milk, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, shellfish, fish & meat. However, it is possible to have allergy for any of the foods, so food diary is indeed a handy tool. Rast tests are used for diagnosis of food allergy, but they are not 100%. It is possible to have a negative Last test despite having allergy to food and also vice versa. Also, sometimes a child can have non-allergic reaction to a food, which cannot be picked up in laboratory tests. If this approach does not lead you to any conclusion, I would suggest you to consult an allergist-immunologist, who will ask you in very much detail and may suggest you some investigations. He may also advise you to keep a food diary. Hope this will help you. Wish your daughter the best of the health. Regards.",1,"tree nut, milk, peanut, tree, nut, soy, egg, shellfish, fish"

An allergy is as an overreaction to usually harmless substance that the immune system determines is harmful, even if it is not.

From that moment forward, the immune system recognizes the allergen and sets up a defense by releasing the chemical into the blood that may cause various symptoms.

1011,"my son is 19 years old he got cold and cough , cough gets worse at night he cant sleep took him to the doctor twice first doctor said it is pollen allergy and mild throat infection only prescribed muconyl and bronochol but he said cough even more later doctor prescribed Levofin 500mg but cough is still there with same intensity, he could not sleep whole night. I started rubbing vicks and giving him steam he feels better for 1 hour or so and then starts coughing again. please help.","Hi, your son has acute infection which has increased his symptoms looking at his coughing I would say there are chances that he has bronchi constriction which is causing breathing problem and excessive coughing. For his infection let him take antibiotics but for his cough your doctor may have to start him with a bronchi dilator inhaler or at least tablets. Now coming to the allergy part, treatment has to be in step wise manner first if his symptoms is for few months a year like 2-3 months then you start an antihistamine which he has to take daily at night. If your symptoms still persist then your start using steroid nasal spray, it has no side effect, and it controls the allergy very well, and you should start 2 weeks before his symptoms start. If this also does not cure you. Then get yourself tested for allergy, it is called skin prick test you will know what you are allergic to, then if possible you can avoid the allergen, or you can start treatment called immunotherapy. This is currently the best treatment available and your symptoms will easily reduce by 80-90 percent kindly visit you rent specialist he will guide you further and immunologist he will do skin prick test and immunotherapythank you Chat Doctor.",1,"pollen, antibiotic"

House dust mite allergy is a likely possibility given the itchy eyes, runny nose and sneezing. Urticaria can happen (itchy hives) sometimes due to the dust allergy but usually unrelated.

Your hives may or may not be related to your alcohol intake (especially if it occurs right after Chat Doctor.

The airways temporarily constrict and make it difficult for air to move in and out of your lungs, making you feel a tightness around your chest.  The mainstay for treatment is bronchodilator and steroid medications in inhaled form - either pressurized MDI (metered dose inhaler) or rota caps.  The dosage needs to be decided after eliciting detailed history and examining you.  If too severe you might be prescribed a short course of oral steroid.  Do steam inhalation, warm saline gargle, protect yourself from cold, dust and other allergens.  Consume only warm fluids. Before initiating treatment your doctor would prefer to get a complete blood count with Absolute Eosinophil Count (the cells that increase in response to allergy) , Chest x-ray to rule out other causes of your breathlessness, EKG to ensure your heart s working fine and a Spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator medication.",1,dust
1045,Hi im saral from India.some time s I feel difficulty in breathing and my heart beat become fast.this was started when I was loosing weight.but two years back I got some allergy on my fingers.then next year I got allergy in my nose itching and all and this year aim having breathing problem.I become nervous so fast and my heart start racing like hell.so please guide me.,"Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read you question, and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something. There are different reasons that might cause increased heart beats. Simple physical or emotional stress, caffeine products might cause increased heart frequency so It's mandatory to avoid them. All sow, there are different pathologies like anemia, thyroid gland problems like hyperthyroidism that might be the cause of fast heart beats.  An active allergy, as you explain might be another cause. When you experience a high frequency, it might be normal to experience palpitation, chest discomfort or difficulties in breathing deeply. This breathing problems might be related to high heart frequency or may be related to allergy that irritate the respiratory system. If these high frequencies are interfering in your normal daily live, If I was your treating doctor I will recommend some simple examinations. I will recommend an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echocardiography and of course a rhythm holder monitoring for 24 h. This is necessary to have a full view of your mean frequencies during day and night. After these, a full blood check up to exclude anemia or thyroid problems and of course consultation with an allergo-logyst to help you pass the allergy problems. Doing these examinations helps us understand if it is necessary to treat this high frequencies or not. Sometimes, finding the allergy trigger and treating it resolves everything. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.",1,None

I m not allergic to anything else from the lettuce family, so that would be strange to be allergic, but possible I guess.","Hello, Cruciferous (lettuce) vegetables such as cauliflower, radicchio can have high levels of salicylate that can explain the itchy hives that you are having. However, this is usually a secondary trigger for people with idiopathic urticaria (medical term for red, itchy hives that can feel swollen under the skin) and is occasionally generalized (i.e., whole body may be involved in hives). I would not suggest going on a strict low salicylate diet as it is a very difficult diet, but you might want to stop radicchio in your diet and start taking either cetirizine 10\u00a0mg (max twice daily) or Allegra 180\u00a0mg for the next 2-3 weeks until all the hives have cleared up. Sometimes the treatment needs to be continued for 3 months so check with your doctor on the right antihistamines. If you do not high levels of salicylate sensitivity (i.e., can tolerate other foods high in salicylates) then do NOT go on a strict low salicylate diet. Sometimes in people with salicylate sensitivity, one may be able to tolerate some foods but not others in the high salicylate list which may be the same with you.",1,None

Thank you Dawn Alpine,"HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Cold temperatures can cause symptoms of rhinosinusitis and also provoke an asthma attack. This can occur in any persons with a history of these conditions due to effect of the cold on the respiratory tract. It would not be called an allergic reaction but one of the triggers of an attack, in the same way that the common cold is a trigger for an asthmatic attack. Normally trigger responses are treated by avoiding the trigger and/or altering the dose of the preventer if possible. Your doctor would determine if this is a possibility. The response to the cetirizine may indicate that rhinosinusitis is also trigger for your asthma. This can only be taken once daily. The use of a nasal spray may also help. I hope this helps",1,None

I took her to the doc and he said that it might be an allergic reaction to an insect bite or something. He prescribed a cream Advantan . The cream is not helping at all and the sores are getting bigger.

The symptoms of your daughters seem to be related to an allergic reaction. I agree with the treatment of the doctor. I recommend adding antihistamines such as Cetirizine to prevent the itching.

What s going on?","Hello, At this point I don't think allergy medication will be of any use. You are probably having sinusitis which will need to be treated with antibiotics (such as amoxicillin-clavulinic acid) and a steroid nasal spray or any other nasal decongestant used in the morning during congestion.

This is allergies involving the nasal passages, and it would cause the congestion. Allergic rhinitis or sinusitis can exist with other types of allergies such as the skin condition you are describing. Hives that develop when the skin is scratched may indicate a type of chronic urticaria. You can use topical nasal sprays to help with the nasal congestion. A dermatologist may be able to help with the skin reaction. I hope this helps",1,None

I believe it s from Listerine ZERO Total Care which cause me to have slouging inner cheeks but the doctor wouldn t let me speak.

So, if the swelling is subsided now then you need not take Methylprednisolone for the swelling. As far as another antibiotic is concerned then you should consult an Oral Physician and get checked and take the antibiotic according to the need as you have already taking sufficient dose. If you are allergic to Amoxicillin, then you can take other group of antibiotics like Cephalexin, Clindamycin et cetera.

I can understand your concern. Your husband is having chronic cough. Most common cause for chronic cough is allergic asthma and lung infection (tuberculosis). Since he is having family history (mother) positive for similar complaints, possibility of allergic asthma is more likely. So better to take him to pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. He will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti-allergic (montelukast) once a day at night is also beneficial.Don't worry, he will be alright.

I experienced rapid heart beat last night after I ate fried fish and red spots occurred all over my body and I felt like my head was so hot that it seems like its going to burst. Everything went back to normal after I drink soft drinks (sprite). My parents gave me anti-allergy medicine but I was afraid to take it because It might make it worst. I also experienced this last week, after eating dried fish. I am 22 years old now, and when i was in Grade 5, i had an asthma attack. I cannot breath air and was taken in ICU after I ate Tuna Fish. Only those times I have those kind of reactions but most of the time nothing happens if i eat any kind of fish. Do you think I am allergy to fish, doc? What kind of allergy is it? If it will happen again next time, will it be a threat to my life?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. As you are not experiencing symptoms every time you eat fish, first I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather than fish allergy. Histamine fish poisoning is a relatively common type of food poisoning. It occurs after consumption of improperly preserved or inadequately refrigerated fish (Fish require stringent refrigeration for preservation). It occurs due to presence of excess of a substance called histamine in the fish. The symptoms are the ones you described - skin rash, itching, headache, palpitation, sometimes breathlessness, etc. The symptoms develop within a few minutes of consumption of fish and usually subside by 6, rarely last up to 12 hours. A very important thing to know is that it is not possible to know whether the fish is likely to cause histamine poisoning by look or even taste of the fish. It looks and tastes same. Only sometimes one feels a typical peppery or burning taste in mouth while consuming fish, one can suspect it is rich in histamine and one should not consume it. Usually antihistamines medications like chlorpheniramine and sanitizing are used for treatment of symptoms. So, in your case, I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather fish allergy. It is even more common wish some variety of fish like Tuna, Sardine, Mahi-mahi, etc. It is not an allergy. Furthermore, it is usually benign and self-limited, but rarely it can cause death. If you experience any serious symptom like difficulty in breathing, dizziness, palpitation, etc. it is advisable to go to ER and get examined by physician and treated. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,fish

The white patch on the lips that can be wiped off leaving red area beneath can be fungal infection which should be treated with antifungal medication. Based on weight of the child, 3 mg/kg of weight dose of Fluconazole should be given once a day to cure this infection for 5-7 days. The black dots inside the cheek cannot be fungal infection. If they are painless, they might be moles or melanin pigmentation as they develop on the skin without causing any harm. You can ignore them. However, if pain develops or the dots ulcerate, then a dentist should be consulted for the clinical examination and further investigations and treatment. I hope this information helps you.

Well after going through your query its quite clear that you have had a severe allergic reaction to penicillin in the past. And I want to make you clear that once if a person is diagnosed of having penicillin allergy will be allergic to penicillin for the rest of his life.so there is no need to find if you are still allergic.there is no way to get it desensitized. Infact if u consume penicillin once more there may be chances of life-threatening anaphylaxis reaction. And there is no need to rely much on only penicillin as there are many new antibiotics are released which are very effective. So there are alternatives to penicillin which are safe and very effective thatch there is no need to worry about it. Just don't forget to tell your doctor that you are allergic to penicillin then they prescribe u an equally effective medicines. I hope this solves your query. Thanks and take care.

I screamed - he took out the needle without removing the dye. It is now thirty-five years later. I ve been diagnosed with cancer of the brain, cancer of the spine (incorrect), multiple sclerosis, spinal stenosis, three herniated discs, scoliosis. By the way, the reason I went for a mylogram thirty years ago was for a numbness in my left thigh which disappeared two weeks later. I was in excruciating pain after the procedure and I had l05 degree fever. At the present time, my pain is mainly in my feet and toes. It feels like a thousand needles stabbing and burning. I should also add I have neuropathy and find it impossible to balance and walk due to this and the pain. I was allergic to Lyrica - my tongue started to swell up and had a hard time trying Neurotin. It made me very lethargic. I also was treated with ten 80 miligrams of Oxycontin and 8 thirty miligrams of Oxycodin which I got off of because I told the doctor I lept building up a tolerance for the drug and required higher and higher doses which caused me to develop a paralytic colon or sluggish colon. I am still taking one 30 miligram tablet at night with a ten miligram valium. A neurologist at Cornell is suggesting I take Cymbalta, 30 miligrams once a day. I am trying to stop the Oxycodin and Valium which takes the edge off the pain in my feet. I looked up Cymbalta to see if there would be a problem stopping the drug if I had to. To my dismay, the doctor on the internet said that it is nearly impossible to wean off of because of the doses of 60 miligrams and 30 miligrams, resulting in horrible withdrawal symptoms. What do you suggest? Please help - desperate and broke.","Hi, Cymbalta is certainly a good option for you. It is used very commonly and there are no problems in tapering it off. It is not like opioids and even if it is stopped abruptly, there are only minor discontinuation symptoms. Furthermore, it is not habit-forming and one does not develop tolerance to it. If you are still worried and would prefer a medicine that is available in a wider range of dose strengths then you can try amitriptyline (Email), which also works well in neuropathic pain.

For how long you're suffering from it? Any other associated problem? Like diabetes ? Any fever? Any history of heart problems? Any liver problem? Any medications apart from hypertension ones?  Which medicine you're taking for hypertension right now? And for how long you're taking it? What is your BP reading?  Longstanding uncontrolled hypertension ultimately does cause damage to small arteries leading to antipathies which may give you these symptoms and it is also associated with naturopathies too, but again it should be diagnosed after careful evaluation by a physician.  Another probability is that you might be having some vasculitis which is giving you these symptoms. If I am your attending physician, I will go for FBC, ESR , LIPID PROFILE along with the DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF BOTH UPPER and LOWER LIMBS to rule out any arterial insufficiency.  If you are really concerned do meet your doctor, he may also get your X-ray of both hand and feet too.  Meanwhile stay calm and continue with your hypertension medications.

1137,"Hi for past two years, why i suffer from heavyhead and watery eyes especially after headbath. I am female, 39 years old now. How can I prevent this problem if i have headbath?. Nowadays I have headbath once in a month because of this probelm. I usually take the tabulets Telecast L, Synasma, Topceff 200 which is prescribed by doctor for allergy","HiT hanks for your query. I think you are suffering from allergic rhino-sinusitis. I think for sinusitis you are suffering from heavy head. Please go for an x-ray para-nasal sinuses to exclude chronic sinusitis and polypoid sinus diseases. If anything found on x-ray, a CT scan of para-nasal sinuses may be done to properly evaluate it. If any polypoid changes occur in the sinuses then FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) can be done to remove it permanently. Otherwise, you should continue to take telecast L, NASA but not Topped 200 for prolonged period.  In addition to that you may consult an allergist and may go for skin prick test and specific IGE tests to detect specific allergen and immunotherapy to that allergen so that you can be protected from that allergen. I also advise you to go for a spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and management of it properly. I think all these will give you remission of these symptoms. You can try our premium services to get further answers on these issues if you have further queries. Thank you.",1,None

1141,"Hello, Recently I developed this allergy 6 months ago, where my face turns red with hives . This only happens when I eat strawberries, berries, pineapples, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers or any food similar to it. Also when I use any cosmetics were it contains glitter or when I use lipsticks closer to red tones I develop this hive, but when I use eyeliner, face powder containing no glitter, nothing happens. I only develop this hive the day after I eat or use these cosmetics. First symptoms, my face would turn red and it will feel itchy. Then a few hours later, my face will become swollen around the eye area. I used to be able to eat and use this product with no problem, I don t know what trigger my body to develop this allergy to certain products. Any idea what is going on? Thank you","Hello, The symptoms you describe and the relation to foods does seem consistent with urticaria that can be triggered in some people by foods rich in salicylates. Urticaria is a condition when mast cells in the skin release histamine after simple triggers such as scratching (physical), but also to temperature change (such as hot shower or cold-induced urticaria), stress, infections etc. Foods high in salicylates can also trigger and the foods you mention do fall in that category. Long-acting antihistamines such as Allegra 180\u00a0mg once daily for 3 months should be tried to see the effect. Removing foods high in salicylates as a trial for a maximum period of 4 weeks is recommended, but no longer if there has no obvious effect. If there is evidence of tree or grass pollen allergy, then these can act as secondary triggers. You can visit the patient information website allergy.or.uk for more information on salicylates if you wish. Hope that helps. Best Wishes.",1,"tree, grass, pollen"

For allergic bronchitis you may ask your doctor to add long acting bronchodilator nebulization like Foretell or Albuterol which may prevent recurrent episodes of wheezing, oral antihistamines, montelukast and bucolic combinations which prevent allergic response and helps in clearing chest of secretions. Episodes of cough, wheezing, chest congestion occur due to exposure to an allergen. You will need to identify what is triggering such episodes. It may be allergens like pollen, dust, mite etc., Sometimes chemicals like perfumes, mosquito repellents etc. Adequate treatment may not be as effective if exposure to allergens is continued.

I hope you feel better soon, It is a kind of allergy or hyper sensitivity reaction may be due to your medication or else maybe this is a sort of cervical radiating pain due to neurovascular compression on nerve endings in your spine at the cervical region.

For my patients I may recommend Advil tabs when needed, hot gentle massaging with topical anti-inflammatory gels, B12 vitamin supplements and muscle relaxants with some neck stretching exercises and spinal straightening exercises will be effective for most of the cases .in more severe and chronic cases steroid tabs or injections are prescribed.  If pain persists I recommend MRI scan on cervical vertebrae to exclude any disc herniation and follow them up with your neurologist for better evaluation and management.

The sneezing that you are describing seems allergic only. Many allergies do not show up on the allergy panel.

1196,My grandson had a red motteled rash on his upper body front and back. It is prickely but is flat so it does not look like a heat rash or anything that raises to a bump. H did run a slight fever but is fine now except the rash as not gone away. Could it be a form of heat rash or is it more likely a allergic reaction to something. He is six. Thank you I will check with his family and get back to you I may just take his to his peditrition tomorrow.,"Dear Concerned.,Thanks for writing to us. In all probability, the history of prickly sensation is suggestive of subcutaneous denaturation of proteins in the lower stratum of skin and subsequent allergic reaction that ensues against denatured protein underneath producing prickly heat rashes on the exposed parts of the body. Kindly apply smoothening creams/lotions such as Lotion calamine over the affected area generously and do not allow exposure to Sun for a three to four days. The lesions will subside. If there is fever pls take him to local doctor as it indicates infection.",1,None

I have to take allergy medication and have a shower asap. If I dont change straight away it gets worst. what can be done so I can still enjoy the sea and swimming with my kids.Paul","Hi, I can understand your concern for itchy red skin with hive like spots after swimming. I can get from query that you are suffering from Aquaponic Urticaria or water induced hives. It is a common condition caused by bursting of allergy producing cells known as \""mast cells\"" due to certain aggravating factors present in the environment. As the chemical inside them is released it produces a rash which you have mentioned. As you know very well the best part is staying away from aggravating factor. But other than this the long term effective treatment for this is by oral anti histamine like loratadine under medical advice. It is one of the Chat Doctor.  You can take loratadine daily or preferably few hours before swimming. Take care.",1,None

Dust allergy has become a major problem with the growing urbanization, changes in housing with little natural light or air and reliance on A/C units that increases the humidity. Allergy testing is highly recommended to know the extent of her allergies, whether it is house dust mite, or mixed with animal dander, molds, fungal spores, grass pollen etc. There are various private labs in Mumbai that offer blood test (would recommend specific IGE test rather than others) such as Metropolis etc. and these need to be reviewed by an experienced Chest physician with interest in Allergy or an Allergist. Long acting antihistamines such as Allegra 180 one daily, alone nasal spray 2 sprays/nostril for 3 months is recommended. The tests will guide duration and seasonal therapy. I hope this helps.

In my opinion, you're all symptoms are mostly due to stress and anxiety. But better to first rule out heart related diseases like arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) as this can cause similar symptoms. So get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia and other heart diseases. Possibility of stress and anxiety is more in your case. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution.

But my blood pressure has been doing the high/normal stuff for some time.","Hello thanks for posting at Chat Doctor.First I would want to get some information whether you are a known hypertension patient and if you are on any medications. Your heart rate is definitely low. I guess you must be on medications for blood pressure control which also lower the heart rate (beneficial effect). IF you are not on any BP medications, then you must get evaluated for why do you have such slow heart rate. See, there is no immediate risk, but there must be a cause for a heart rate less than 50 bpm. If you are an athlete or on BP medications then such a heart rate is acceptable. Your BP readings are under normal range, and they do not seem worrisome. Please do continue taking your medications. Wishing you good health. Regards",1,None

1231,"I have H.Pylori and I m allergic to penicillin (hives). Is there any way to treat this infection WITHOUT using Flagyl (metronidazole). Would I be able to get rid of the infection using clarithromycin, omeprazole, famotidine and a good probiotic? What do you suggest?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The regimen most commonly recommended for first line treatment of H. pylori is triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin (1 g twice daily), and azithromycin (500 mg twice daily) for 7 to 14 days. We suggest treatment for 10 days to two weeks. Most of the treatment regimens include a medication called a proton pump inhibitor which decreases the stomachs' production of acid. Two antibiotics are also generally recommended as this reduces the risk of treatment failure and antibiotic resistance. If you are allergic to metronidazole do not use the same combination of antibiotics. You can use the combination of azithromycin, omeprazole and famotidine, but there will be risk of antibiotic resistance if we use single antibiotic combination. With the use of probiotics it may help you to control the symptoms. Thank you.",1,"penicillin, amoxicillin, antibiotic"
1232,dr. Sb I read ur MSG. Thank u soo much but I am really concerned. Actually he has these symptoms for past one year.. Now he only has bouts Imogen cough in the morning. No wheezing as such. Is it asthama or simple allergy I dont know. His father also has it . Once he gets up in the morning he coughs and takes it out then fine.my son also coughs so much that its difficult to send him to school in the morning. When he cums back he is fine. In the evening when I take him to doctors they say is chest is clear. Dont know what to do for the morning cough... Any reply in this regard will be really helpful.Just mentioning it here that one doctor said its step 3 asthama and gave clenil  and ventolin inhaler 6 month program. The other said that its childhood allergy and gave ceretide and rigix for a month and follow up. Which one should I follow. Gave him ventolin puffs last night and clenil for the first time and he was better in the morning . Gave puffs again in the morning. But now read on clenil inhaler that not suitable for children.

1259,"I recently got a rash on my ears, cheeks and arms. I have tiny red bumps mainly prevalent on my cheeks and ears. My ears feel inflamed and are very itchy. My cheeks and arms were itchy but are no longer. Im wondering if I just recently developed some food allergy that caused this rash.","Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. The condition you have referred to is called Urticaria or hives. It's an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IGE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non-responding cases there are many other Chat Doctor.  Hope this will help you in resolving your query. Thank you",1,None

A new symptom has now arisen - I have a lot of phlegm and my nose has been bleeding on an off for a week or so - this i assumed was because I was blowing my nose too much but in the last couple of days the blood is thickening and becoming strands that look like worms and then come up with clear phlegm. I have read a few internet blogs saying that they are parasitic worms, they do look like worms but are not moving.

Welcome to ChatDoctorYour daughter seems to have developed an allergic reaction to something which she came in contact with at night. Was this the first such reaction or has she had similar allergies in the past? It is important to find out what caused the allergy, as re-exposure to it will cause the hives and itching again. Was there any contact with dust, pollen, outdoor plants, insects, pets, any possible bed bugs, mites, or new medication? Any history of eating out, especially seafood, nuts, etc? Did anyone else experience similar symptoms? The Ben Chat Doctor.  Prednisolone may be needed if there is a severe outbreak of rashes. In case of severe symptoms like breathlessness, puffiness of face, lips, go to the ER immediately. Apply calamine lotion over the itchy skin. These are just temporary symptomatic treatments. To prevent further attacks, the trigger cause needs to be found. If this often happens, keep a note of any possible factors, as I mentioned, that could be the trigger each time. Antihistamine needs to be continued till the symptoms subside completely, maybe 3-5 days. Visit the dermatologist if they are persistent even on treatment. Your doctor may suggest blood tests if needed. Skin tests for allergy are generally not done during an active episode of hives. A later date may be given to you. You may be referred to an allergy specialist. For now, continue treatment as advised and observe. Hope this helps.",1,"dust, pollen, nuts"

Later when my symptoms persist , i went to see my doctor again, he ordered to do Allergy test to check why i have hives which i did, i was only allergy to crabs (sea food) and mite, then i decided to take STDs test myself , which the result came out this way","Dear James, I am sure you are worried sick about this but hope you have visited an Infectious Disease or GUM specialist to get the whole range of STDs checked out. Of course, the HIV 1 and 2 ab test is the right test given the time frame (when antibodies to the virus would have formed IF you have the reaction, but clearly not so) but the most sensitive test remains HIV PCR or Viral load if you had more encounters since. The feeling that you describe can be scabies but would be evident on clinical examination, although a rash would mean this is urticaria. House dust mite and seafood allergy occasionally come up positive on blood tests, so if you really have reactions (allergic) when you have seafood the result is correct. You need a throat swab, HIV PCR/VS and get seen by a specialist to lower the apprehension and hope things turn out well. As per the urticaria, long acting non sedating antihistamines for 3 months is the treatment. Thanks.",1,"mite, dust"

1291,I have 5 itchy areas on my forearm that swelled up into large red lumps after scratching them. They have gone down quite a bit but have not gone away since its onset two weeks ago.

However, you must remember that a one-off course of antibiotics may not do any harm but if you need antibiotics again, do consult your doctor to see if this is really required. Allergies can feel like a constant flu infection, and testing is recommended. You may already have had tests but skin prick testing or specific IGE blood test for house dust mite, animal dander, molds (alternative, aspergillus, Cladosporium etc.) can be difficult to avoid and treat unless you know that these are also problems. Rhinosinusitis or just rhinitis resolves on long acting antihistamines and nasal steroid spray like alone taken for 6-8weeks. Thanks.",1,"dust, antibiotic, mite, animal"

The white bumps can be because of the fungal infection or smokers palate(if you are smoker). Nothing to be panic, consult an oral physician and get it evaluated.

You have to start anti-allergic medicines like levocetrizine, fexofenedin. Nsaid with decongestant will be helpful to subside blockage of nostrils. Steam inhalation at bedtime will be helpful. You will get recovery within 5 to 7 days. If it is recurrent than I would suggest going for allergy test to find out any specific allergen, so you can start prevention. Start exercise, yoga and deep breathing exercise after getting cure. Consult your physician for further guidance and proper medical management.",1,None

In my opinion you should avoid those food items to whom you are allergic. This is the only and the best prevention.

Yes, this does sound like an allergy. It is often difficult to identify what you are allergic to apart from things like seafood which cause allergies in a lot of people.

The venom between horsefly, bees and wasps do differ and therefore not everyone gets anaphylaxis to horsefly stings even if they are allergic to bees and wasps.

We were doing ok with the management of this but recently she has been very disrupted in the night, every hour or so.

1358,"Hello, I was diagnosed with hep c in 1980, am taking narcotics and gabapentin for pain relief from degenerative disc disease, I was apparently having allergic reactions to the gabapentin and was prescribed lactulose with no questions, warnings, contraindications or instructions to follow. Also, no instructions to follow at least 6 hours prior to a serum ammonia level test that was high, now have suffered severe insomnia, nausea, gas, bloating, headaches , rash and pain due to my reluctance to take my regularly prescribed narcotics(Oxycodone and Morphine XR) because they cause constipation, I am taking several of the medications that are contraindicated with LACTALOSE. What should I do and how long should I wait to take my medications that are contraindicated with lactulose. Thank You, Sincerely, Harry Hoskins","Hi, thank you for Providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Neuromuscular assessment is advised along with MRI of spine. As you have degenerative disc disease and also on medication, then to make you understand and help better there is a limitation of the medicine for symptomatic relief. The degenerative disc disease occurs dude to weakness of the spinal muscles which allows the spinal column to reduce in size and then later provides compression on the disc and the pinching of the nerve roots. Usually in my clinical practice such cases with degenerative disc disease are recommended with physical therapy as to get the maximum outcome and reduce the medication. As medicine over a longer run are not good for the kidneys and may lead to damage. Physical therapy like - Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy are useful to control the pain without any side effects and also exercises on a later stage provide the maximum outcome score of Strength of the muscular system. Also, TENS works even better when you are under medication for a shorter time.regards Jay In Chat Doctor.",1,None

By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. Stress and anxiety can cause feeling of chest tightness, chest pressure, inability to take deep breath etc. You are not having allergies and not having smoking habit, so lung related diseases are less likely. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.

I cant stop itching. am I allergic to all foods... ??? please someone help me..","Hello Lisa, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. There are two types of allergy tests - skin prick test (which you have been undergone) and serum tests (Immunogen or LAST). I suggest you not to be worried by test results. These tests are not 100%. They only complement a clinicians decision about diagnosis of your food allergy. If you are demographic, skin testing will give you what we call false positives (means even if test is positive you are not allergic to it). So in a demographic person, skin testing is not a reliable test. So forget the results of skin test if you are demographic!! Diagnosis of food allergy requires a very detailed history about your symptoms & your diet, right from very beginning when you had your first allergy symptoms. This requires a detailed consultation. After suspecting the foods you may be allergic to, you may be advised serum allergy tests to support the diagnosis. The best diagnosis of food allergy is by food challenge which is done at specialized allergy centers. I would suggest you to keep a food diary in which you can keep note of food taken (including ingredients) and every symptom you developed, with time & date. This will help you and your doctor to suspect what is it that may be causing symptoms. Common food allergies are milk, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, fish & shellfish. But one can be allergic to any other food substances from routine diet. Also, I should tell you that there are other gastrointestinal disorders which may mimic food allergy and there is food intolerance (in simple words it means one cannot tolerate some foods) also. A gastroenterologist consultation would be helpful to you if you don't have food allergy. So I would suggest you not to think that you are allergic to all foods! Also, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine (levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine) and montelukast daily to control your symptoms. Wish you best of the health. Regards.",1,"milk, wheat, peanut, tree, nuts, soy, eggs, fish, shellfish"
1361,"Hi, Yesterday the inside of my mouth, including gums and tongue, began to burn and generally feel irritated. It seems to have started in one spot, and now has spread. Eating certain foods is irritating. Now, this evening, my throat is beginning to feel irritated, and my lymph nodes are a bit swollen. Is this seasonal allergies due to pollen, or possible something else?  Shall I just take a Claritin, or see my doctor soon? Thanks, RWB","Hi. Thanks for the query. Yes, it is appearing to be most probably due to some unknown allergic reaction only that is causing inflammation of mouth and throat that is a reason for burning and irritation on eating anything. It will tend to burn more with spicy and acidic foods. As you are already known to have allergies, then it can be due to the things that you are known to be allergic to.

1362,Hi I have been having this weird pain in my lower left abdomen and especially hurts when I jump. Almost as if something is bouncing and straining something. I also had very intense me trial cramps after running. This was in June or July though. But was the worst pain I have ever felt. I also get very sharp pains in my anus and have a very big hemorrhoid . I have lost quite a bit of weight. I was around 135 this time last year and now am just under 120. Lost most of the weight within a month which was last December or Jan. I wasn t sick or anything and was eating normal. Then steadily lost weight till august/septmber where I plateaued to just under120. It hurts when I push on my left side of stomach. My bowel movements vary but mostly I m going three times a day. Or will hit a day where I don t go at all. I find I m very thirsty sometimes(an unquenchable thirst) and get full very quickly. I have also been having heart palpitations every day. This started in September I think. I also have been getting quick intense sharp pains in lower abdomen. They don t happen as often though. Also had this cirrhosis like rash on neck that has mostly gone away except for these two small raised red bumps. Think it was an allergic reaction to several mosquito bites. I m also very sensitive to smells. I am on tricyclen lo birth control and have been having my period regularly and not so irregular( was still getting period every month bug would be few days late sometimes. Would be nice to know what is going on. I should also mention that sometimes I would get nauseous for no apparent reason and would vomit several times in the night. Other times I would wake a up and be nauseous and very sweaty and warm and feel the need to defecate. The nausea would usually go away after I had a bm but the one time I was extremely nauseous for a couple hrs after. This happened mostly in august and September but not happening as often now nor as severe. Im a 20 year old female with allergies or any medical conditions. Hope u can help me.,"Hello k, You have a myriad of symptoms and am unable to like all these together for one diagnosis. It is likely that all are unrelated apart from the rashes on the neck and red raised bumps that is likely to be urticaria. You may have fibromyalgia, but it is important that you exclude other medical causes before coming to that diagnosis. Blood tests such as CBC, ESR, Liver profile, ANA, lipid profile, fasting sugar, TPO antibodies, thyroid profile would be a start. U/S abdomen for your pains + UGI endoscopy to exclude HERD. Only then one can try and get to a treatment plan. Thanks.",1,mosquito

Your insomnia, anxiety, stress etc. are mostly due to methylprednisolone (oral steroid). Steroids should be given as a first line treatment for allergies.

1384,My mom had a knee replacement in October 2013 . In April 2014 she started to get hives all over her body and they have latest until now March 2015 . Basically one year . She is taking Zyrtec and it helps a little but she still gets the hives every day . She recently had an allergy test and the results said she is allergic to nickel . What should she do? Can she really be allergic to the knee replacement ? Besides going through the second surgery what should she do?,To know the cause for this you need to do different allergy test. I Don't think that she will have allergy with the transplant knee. Because the material which is used for knee use to be a different special non-allergic material. But to have conformation you can visit your or tho and check with the material he has kept and do an allergy test with it. Now at present she can take symptomatic treatment and I suggest ask her to do regular walking or cycling exercises. Because doing regular exercises also helps for reducing inflammation in body. Also check with the hematologist and dermatologist for further use of medication as well to check other causes of this. And if there is anything which can be done to identify the kind of allergy apart from allergy test. Here I told that it can not be total knee replacement as a cause of this because after replacement she was fine for more than 6 months if there is something related to it than it will start immediate after replacement with in a week time. So I suggest having close look on allergy test and visit a different doctor if one is not able to treat it properly. Take care.,1,nickel

Regarding your query for sinusitis and management of allergy, I would like to say that allergy is an immunological disorder, and it can't be cured but any way if we can identify the possible allergen than avoidance of allergen is the best treatment. But if allergen is unavoidable or allergen is unknown than we should consult allergy specialist for skin test to find out the list of allergen and after that treatment is done by desensitization of body by suitable vaccines. Your second query is for your sinusitis, for this I would like to say these sinus inflammation may be Allergic / infective. Sometimes there are some other nasal conditions like deviated nasal septum / septal spur / polyps / hypertrophied turbinates etc. which are responsible for recurrent sinusitis.

Within one day I developed a running nose, draining down the throat, and now am coughing and have a headache.  There may be 2 down pillows in a closet in my  bedroom.

For a child of 7 you must avoid aspirin. Paracetamol is a better choice. It can also cause gastric irritation.

Aspirin and polyps of the nose with asthma occurs in a group of asthmatics. They should avoid other Chat Doctor.  Or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. Subsequent exposures to these allergens can make the symptoms worse, so take care. Skin allergy test is not very specific, but there are doctors who strongly believe in it. I suggest that you avoid these for the time being and as he grows older you can check him out for asthma with a pulmonologist.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of cough variant asthma is more likely. You are having family history of allergy. You are allergic to dust. Both of these are in favor of asthma more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Continue montage LC, once a day at night. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",1,dust

1485,My 5 yr old daughter started with a rash on her face which in a day spread to her entire body head to finger tips. Within 24 hrs she had common cold symptoms.

The bumps seem to be vesicles Would you please clarify a few things for me? 1)have you had chicken pox /varicella? 2)do you see any bite marks on the affected arm? 3)have you been outdoors, camping for instance? Was there any contact or exposure to poison ivy or oak? 4)are you on any medications? 5)did you have any pain., itching or tingling on the affected area before the vesicles appeared? 6)are they limited to one side of the body? Herpes zoster /Shingles start out as altered sensation on the skin (pain/itching/tingling)with redness, usually on side of the body and limited to a specific area. It occurs in those individuals who already had chicken pox, by the reactivation of the virus that remains dormant in the nervous system. This then progress to form vesicles which appear in cluster and is filled with clear fluid which may become infected (pustules). The pain is usually severe. This resolves. In a couple of weeks although the scabs on the healing vesicles may take longer to disappear. Poison ivy or oak may cause this lesion. Intense pruritic (itching), pain and redness of underlying skin occurs. Allergic reaction will usually have a trigger (known allergens like insect venom, certain food items, medications for instance) and will result in a generalized (all over the body) rash (without fluid), unless it is contact dermatitis (in which case it will be localized to the area of contact with the allergen). Bug bites can be identified by bite marks and may resemble an allergic reaction (if you were already allergic to it) or it may have a reaction limited to area immediately surrounding the bite. Certain systemic infections may cause cutaneous manifestation. I recommend you see your physician/dermatologist who could assess, diagnose and treat it. Do not apply any OTC medications without consulting your doctor. Some of these contains corticosteroids that will worsen the rash if it is an infection. Keep the area clean and Chat Doctor.  If the rash or pain is too severe, fever more than 102F occurs, or any worrying symptom like lethargy, severe headache, giddiness is present, go to the ER right away. Hope this helps.

Since you are having allergy, we should rule out allergic bronchitis in your case. Chest tightness, coughing, post nasal discharge etc. are commonly seen with allergic bronchitis. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Also take combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti-allergic (montelukast) Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

1556,"HI, My 7 year old daughter came home from school yesterday with a red ring around her eye... her actuaul eye is slightly red but what is most worrisome is the ring and swelling, it literally looks like she has a black eye, but the color is red instead. She has a history with allergies, i.e. excema and has been on an antibotic for 10 days less than a week ago. We have had a family cold that has been passed around, hence the antibiotic, while she was feeling down, she had a few mornings with crusty eyes and some redness. I am just curious if I should take her to the ER to make sure there isn t anything in her eye... she has complained that light hurts to look at and I know at school she was given a tissue to wipe her eye because it was tearing up. My instinct tells me she must have irritated at school, making it more pronounced.... not sure what to do. Thanks, Meg","Hi, Round ring around eyes, associated with swelling most likely indicates a trauma/collision there. Although this is called black eye, color can vary depending on age and depth of blood collection. Superficial bleeds will initially appear red and later change to blue and the black. If there are no complaints of severe headache or vomiting, you need not worry-just apply ice pack and give paracetamol for minor pain. But if she also complains of photophobia (hurting by light) and watering of the same eye, there is chance that she got a corneal abrasion/ulcer during the hit-for this I would recommend seeing an ophthalmologist, as this may need antibiotic Chat Doctor.

Also, if this is the first time, did the assumed allergic reaction occur immediately after the first dose or after a few doses, and which dose caused this?

This will have to be ascertained by your treating doctor, so please do consult him/her for the same. The next thing is, if this is indeed an allergic reaction to Bactrim, you will have to immediately discontinue this medication. For this as well, you will have to report to your doctor, who will confirm the cause, discontinue the current medication and initiate a substitute. In the meantime, avoid any irritation to the area of the rash, wear comfortable clothing, avoid scratching the region, and avoid application of any prescribed medication on the region of the rash.Also, please Chat Doctor.

1580,"I had my dentures relined yesterday,they were done straight away with a soft acrylic paste and put in my mouth,after leaving the dentists i started to get a bad burning sensation and sore throat ,went back to dentist he said it was a gum irratation and it would go away,i cannot wear my dentures,mouth hurts throat sore.Will this go.He said i may have an allergy to acrylic.not wore dentures since but gums still irrated 48hrs later.Any advice please","Hello. Yes u had pointed correctly it can be allergy to relining material. Reliner contains monomer which causes sore throat and burning sensation. And it will take approx 7-15days to completely heal. If a cold refiner was used and u gets the same symptom again on wearing denture after 7 days then it is allergy to other contents of the relining material. And that refiner needs to be replaced. Meanwhile u can use analgesic, anesthetic mouthwash for relief...and take some antiallergics. A denture is usually made of acrylic. Heat cure mostly and u were using denture earlier so you are not allergic to heat cure acrylic/ acrylic itself. U can get a new denture fabricated or ask your dentist for relining by heat cure acrylic. Remember in cold cure relining material unused monomers causes adverse chemical reaction on mucosa sometimes. So u should always avoid this type of relining or rebasing in the future.",1,None

I have eliminated food allergies, mites, and dry skin. Now, I am wondering about autoimmune disorders. Are there any of those disorders or diseases that have itching as a symptom?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. One most important thing I would like to know is whether you itch without hives/skin lesions/urticaria or with them. If you have hives/urticaria, I would say you are having chronic urticaria. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will perform some tests for physical urticaria and suggest some blood tests like total blood count, ESR, serum anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies and urine & stool examination. Some of these tests are for autoimmune disorders. Then he can treat accordingly. But if you are not having skin lesions at all and only itching, I would not think of allergy at first. The causes are many like Chat Doctor.  So I would suggest you to consult a physician who may suggest you tests like CBC, ESR, blood sugar, SEPT, total proteins including albumin & globulin, urea, creatinine and urine & stool routine and microscopic examination. Then he can treat you accordingly. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,None

I get affected easily from Bangalore climate - sneezing , nosing, nose & eye irritation etc particularly in mornings. My age is 65. I do 1 Hr walking in the morning and take controlled food. Otherwise I m fit and am still working in an Engg Firm. Advise me ways to control this allergic deficiency and to reduce eosnophlia count. YYYY@YYYY 0000 Bangalore","Hello, Reading your query and the results of the blood tests, I presume that the percentage of eosinophil count is 10% that has several causes. The commonest cause in tropical countries is parasite infections, and antiparasitic treatment is recommended after stool culture studies. This is a must before going through unnecessary tests or treatments. If the eosinophil count remains high and sneezing and rhinoconjuncitivitis symptoms persist, it would suggest allergies as the underlying cause. Pollen allergy, smoke (industrial) are major factors that need high dose antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. The duration of treatment will depend on the trigger (i.e., seasonal vs perennial [all year around]). There are several other causes but infections, allergies and rarely autoimmune diseases are causes of raised eosinophil counts. I also hope you have recognized red flags such as significant loss in weight and appetite that should be taken more seriously. I hope this was useful. Best Wishes.",1,pollen

I have used salicylic acid ointments but the cracks do not heal fully and re-appear after very short duration.I have noticed one particular phenomena. When the cracks are about to heal say around 90 % and if suddenly I have tension due to any reason even for a moment I feel as if my blood is boiling and feel strange and acute itching under the sole my feet and within few minutes there are cracks again. within next one or two days skin thickens around the cracks.

Im on clonozapam which only allows me to sleep 3-4 hours per night and then my racing heart wakes me. Was on thryoid meds last year which caused thryoid storm and had severe heart pounding. My dr. Said it was thryoid storm, the ER doc said it was panic attacks, had several heart tests, lung X-ray all normal, why does it seem that my heart racing and asthma coincide. I started taking 1500 mg of magnesium and 1200 mg calcium to help with the cough spasms . It helps. Im fine during the night and morning with no asthma symptoms, but it starts around 3pm until bedtime. No one seems to have answers for me. They even sent me to a psychiatrist and all he did was double the clonazapam at night so the panic attacks didnt wake me which worked for awhile, now I hardly sleep at all and my heart races constantly but not pounding like when I was in thryoid drugs. Im tired of feeling this way. Ive had a long history of asthma in the past, but no occurrence in about 5 years after having my stomach stapled around my esophogus due to severe reflux which fixed the problem. I know I have allergies. Ever since working outside in the spring, its been bad and cant seem to calm the asthma down.","Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Racing heart beats may due to cardiac cause, thyroid hormone imbalance or due to hypoxia due to asthma. So get done ECG, echocardiography, thyroid profile, blood sugar level, serum electrolytes, Hologram and spirometry once to diagnose the cause. Keep checking TSH levels once every 6 months. For Asthma, it seems you are not controlled. So get back with the symptoms and your treatment history and Chat Doctor.  If we cure asthma then all other problems will be cured with this if this is the basic problem. Have adequate regular sleep, plenty of fluids, nutritious diet with required calorie and regular outdoor exercises for your wellbeing. Hope I answered your question. Get back with the reports.

I can understand your concern.  Chronic cough is commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. Since your chest x-ray is normal, no need to worry about lung infection.

I have read that you can have an allergic reaction to certain manufacturers and is why it was positive the second time.

There is usually no need to repeat this so many times as in you case. If the question is latent TB (i.e., the doctors think you may have TB, but not sure) then a new blood test is available called TB-Spot or Quantifier assay. The flu shot is probably the seasonal influenza jab you had and if the symptoms happened within a few hours, it is possible you have sensitivity to one of the recipients in the jab.

The red plaques are probably unrelated to the headaches and night sweats in time, and if they are itchy red lesions slightly raised and disappear without a trace it means urticaria eruptions.

It's an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IGE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids.

Have blood tests to rule out any internal disease or vitamin deficiencies. You may take folic acid 5 mg thrice a day with iron tab. Antibiotics may be needed if there is secondary bacterial infection. Apply antibiotic cream with mild steroid like mpmetasone. You may avoid soap, cosmetics and lipstick for good and fast result. Avoid bad habit of lip licking, if it is there. Do not traumatize the lip skin with your nails. You might get good result after few weeks. I hope this would help you in your treatment.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

It is best to use cough etiquette when you are around other people-cough or sneeze into your shoulder (not your palms), or into a tissue which you dispose. As for the brownish phlegm, if your fever is settling and you're getting better overall, there's no need to worry about them. If you have difficulty breathing or a temperature more than 102 F, contact your physician.

1749,"Hello Sir,I am Indrajeet from India - Age 37 years. Since last 4-5 years I have developed severe allergy to dust and cold. It aggravates during winters, coupled with the high pollution levels we have here in India. Earlier, I also used to develop a nose abscess for which I had to consume antibiotics (Augmentin / Levoflox etc.). While regular cleaning of the nostrils with warm water (1-2 times a day) has kept me off this abscess problem for over a year now, I still suffer badly from this throat infection problem. I got rid of my tonsils just last year. My throat goes completely dry (I believe there is lack of sufficient saliva generation) at nights (in sleep) and I have a terrible time swallowing for first 1-2 hours of the mornings, once I gett up. To reduce the tingling feeling due to allergy (dust) I consume Zyrtec and Decdan SOS and it does relieve me of the sensitivity and itching. However, my throat continues to pose problems every single morning. In worst times, the ENT has also put me on Zithrox to get rid of my throat infection. However, this is just a temporary solution.

I was afraid it was something more, especially after self diagnosing and driving myself crazy, or I figured it was probably a yeast infection (since I m uncircumcised and I wasn t washing myself very well) or blood vessels bursting due to sexual intercourse numerous times out of the day but the FNP said that it looked like a possible yeast infection or maybe even an allergic reaction to my partners Copper IUD? After applying some anti fungal cream (i believe it was terconazole?) the red bumps pretty much went away. We stopped seeing each other and its been about 2 weeks since I last saw her. However, now I noticed a red bump under my shaft? It doesn t hurt, I have no pain or burning when I urinate (less of course if I haven t been drinking enough water), I have no discharge or pus, doesn t look like a blister or any noticeable symptoms of anything to really worry me until I saw this thing! I thought it might just be a hair follicle or something? I did take a picture of it. I m trying not to worry but obviously its scaring me. Please help! Where do I go from here? Thank you in advance!","Hii.welcome to Chat Doctor .you are having folliculitis.my opinion is that,1.don't squeeze the lesion.2.apply antibiotic cream like fusiform ointment twice daily on the lesion for 5 days.3.take analgesics like tablet ibuprofen twice daily for 5 days, if it pains.4.take tablet levocetrizine twice daily for 5 days, if it itches.5.maintain good hygiene around the area.

Your daughter is suffering from hypersensitivity to peanut. This might have gone unnoticed in earlier years because of limited exposure to the allergy causing agent. When a patient is exposed to the allergy causing agent the first time, it usually doesn't cause a significant reaction.

The white spot surrounded by redness that you referred to seems to be a surplus which contains pus within. It might be discharging or if not you can take a sterile needle to prick it to relieve the pressure within the tooth. This will also lower the intensity of Pain. The surplus suggests that your tooth is infected and most probably there is periapical lesion as well which will be seen via X-Ray. Yea you can take the medicine as the same has no affinity with the Chat Doctor.  Your Tooth might need a Root Canal in this Case as the infection can only subside for some days or week by medicine and it(pain) will recur. You might be needing an X-Ray of the involved tooth to see the extension of infection, so the dentist can see whether the tooth really can be saved with root canal or should be extracted. I suggest you to visit the Dentist and get the tooth treated. Thanks and",1,None

However, we cannot also rule out other more worrisome infections or disease processes that can cause this.

However, this may seem but is usually not the case. What happens is that your allergies are getting worse, and once a day cetirizine is insufficient to make a difference to the symptoms. Avil injection is a short-acting but rapidly acting antihistamine with sedative properties and will NOT recommend this for long term use. You must get a blood test or specific IGE OR a skin prick test to find out what your allergies are. If it is house dust mite, avoidance measures should be in place but optimizing medical treatment with long acting antihistamines like Allegra and nasal corticosteroid sprays are recommended. Immunotherapy (subcutaneous or sublingual) are reserved for patients who do not respond on medical treatment. Thanks.",1,"dust, mite"

This may cause repeated infection and features that you are presenting. If sputum changes to yellow or green color with cough then antibiotics with anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  For confirming asthma, get done AEC counts and spirometry once. Because even with chronic sinusitis and repeated throat infection the symptoms will be similar to asthma.

I would suggest you to go to an immunologist or allergy specialist. He would do a test called skin prick test. This test will identify most of the allergens your allergic to. This test is better than blood test since it can recognize many allergens at 2 to 3 sitting itself. Once the allergen s identified you can either avoid the allergen or take immunotherapy for that allergen.

His doctor prescribed him topical medicine that has not improved the areas at all. These areas also include the palms of his hands and soles of both feet. Onset was very sudden.

However, for extensive disease systemic treatment with oral immunosuppresses like methotrexate, cyclosporin, Phototherapy (PVA), Biologics etc. may be required for disease control. Specific topical treatment options for psoriasis plaques are topical steroid with or without salicylic acid, topical vitamin D analogues like calcitriol, calcipotriene etc. These are available in ointment form for plaques involving the body and in lotion form for scalp psoriasis. Topical therapy may be combines with oral/systemic therapy for widespread/extensive disease. Besides specific remedies for psoriasis, moisturizers form an important part in the management of psoriasis because of the thick scaly nature of the plaques. Moisturizers enhance the penetration of topical active ingredients as well as prevents or delays side effects like skin atrophy etc. An oral antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg may be required for symptomatic relief from itching. Treatment may take 2-4 weeks to show noticeable improvement. Therefore, I would suggest him to continue with the prescribed medicines and follow up with his doctor every 2-4 weeks.

Let me advise you about tongue swelling. Swollen tongue is actually an abnormal condition in the tongue occurring due to tongue inflammation, where either a part or the entire tongue gets enlarged, and fatter than the normal tongue size. It is true that tongue in its swelling conditions is taken as a kind of defense mechanism which helps in fighting against the infection and aids in healing. However, when there is an excessive swelling for longer time; the swollen tongue can be actually very much harmful. It must be mentioned that tongue inflammation or the swollen tongue condition can result from the excessive fluid accumulation in the tongue tissues and termed as Angioedema. This swollen tongue can also occur due to excess deposit of abnormal substances like the amyloid protein and also can be result from any kind of allergic reactions to certain medicines.

We still feel ashamed and sorry for taking him to the ER at the last minute. We dont want him to suffer like that again for sure. He was on nebs and ok within 24 hours and discharged within 48 hours.

1860,"I recently read the book Wheat Belly and decided to go on a gluten-free diet . I am 47 years old and have had issues my whole life with diarrhea or at least very loose stools nearly every day and have sufferred severe stomach cramps and pain. I also have had nausea more days in my life than I haven t. Over the years, I ve had every test you can imagine starting when I was 10 years old. Nothing has ever been found. In fact, my parents were told that I was creating my symptoms for attention since my only other sibling has cerebral palsy . I even had a specialist I was referred to for fatty liver disease tell my the pains in my stomach were psychosomatic. After 3-4 days of no gluten products, I began to feel better. No diarrhea, no nausea, very little stomach pains. Yesterday I ate several biscuits with no other gluten in the entire day. About an hour after I ate the biscuits, I began to feel a tightness at the base of my throat. I thought it was heartburn, but there was never any burning and antacids didn t help. It continued to get worse and I felt that I had to consciously take deep breaths to get enough air. If I sipped on ice cold water the symptoms would subside for a few minutes - maybe 3 minutes then immediately return. I became concerned this was an allergic reaction to the gluten. I have no other allergies other than seasonal and Sulfa medications. I took a 25 mg Benadryl which did nothing. Two hours later, I took some pseudofed, the only other allergy medication I had on hand. I seriously considered going to the ER but the symptoms reached a certain level and stopped progressing so I did not go. It was 6-7 hours before the symptoms finally went away. I have always eaten a lot of bread and flour so I find it hard to believe that these three biscuits could have caused these symptoms, but I didn t have anything else that I haven t ever had before and this is the only thing I have eaten in a week that had any gluten in that I m aware of. Does this sound like a gluten allergy?",Yes definitely gluten is one protein and this is found in wheat there are many proteins in wheat you history suggest that you have allergy to glut nor wheat whole need to blood serum test for wheat specific antibodies if you have stopped the food for many days even a small one amount can lead to severe allergies even anaphylaxis.

You can apply locally retinoid acid on those areas only, but it will take time and result cannot be full assured. Recently there is a cosmetic surgery known as dermal abrasion.

Thanks for sharing your concern. Pain, swelling, and nausea post extraction is common in third molar extraction, but generally antibiotics and analgesics are prescribed for three to five days to reduce these symptoms and faster recovery. If you are allergic to penicillin, your dentist can prescribe you erythromycin or ciprofloxacin in addition to metronidazole.

This is causing the abnormal menstrual flow, known as neuropathic cycles. Your condition is very much treatable once you get a total evaluation done.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. Telfast 120 is fexofenadine. Fexofenadine and nasal spray will help your nasal and throat symptoms of allergy but not asthma (noise from chest, feeling of being breathless).

If you have no symptoms with this, I would suggest you to take it at least for 2-3 months or as long as you expect exposure to dust and smoke. However, if this does not help you, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing and may advise you allergen immunotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids, etc. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises.

Here, I am giving you some information which can be beneficial to you.1) Maintain good oral hygiene and avoid hot and spicy foods.2) Antiseptic mouth wash(chlorhexidine) for gargles for rapid healing and to prevent secondary infection.3) Topical analgesic gel like Benzedrine which is also having a local anesthetic effect.4) Take folic acid with vitamin B complex to promote healing. Hope this information is helpful, but it would be advisable that you will see your doctor first and then ask for treatment. Thanks.",1,None

1930,"I had a root canal in early may.  Prior to the root canal, my symptoms were a hollow feeling in my left ear and tingling down my jaw.  The endodontist determined that my back lower tooth was not healthy (no infection) and performed a root canal.  The feeling mostly disappeared after the initial root canal, but obviously the endodontist and dentist have been in my mouth several times over the last month and a half, used novacaine, etc. for the crown.  During the entire time, I have had swelling in my upper left cheek (inside), like little pockets of inflammation.  Along with this, my allergies have been bad and I have had sinus pain, only on that left side in my cheek.  After the dentist put my crown on recently, my left gland in my neck became swollen and has not gone down.  The sinus pain comes and goes, the hollow feeling in the ear comes and goes and my jaw below my ear feels stiff and sort of hurts.  I went to the urgent care to rule out an ear infection or strep.

Some people are sensitive towards the gluten and hence the reaction in the form of abdominal pain, crunches etc. A gluten-free diet is recommended which is available in most of the medical shops and food outlets. Also, care should be taken not to consume wheat based products. Besides, consult a doctor to confirm if it is Gluten sensitivity before you can change your diet.

It lasts for a few hours and disappears. It is raised and blotchy. Furthermore, it could be associated with swelling of the eyes and lips as well. Furthermore, it occurs secondary to the infection (fever) or sometimes as an allergy to a Chat Doctor.  (antibiotic, anti-fever medication, etc.). You can continue to take antihistamine like levocetrizine at bedtime for about 1 week. Viral exanthem is a rash which occurs as a part of the fever. It is in flush with the skin, starts on the face and spreads downwards. It is usually non-itchy, but sometimes can itch. Furthermore, it clears spontaneously within 5-7 days. Hope this helps you. Take care.",1,antibiotic

When I went off my zyrtec for the allergy testing, I noticed even more hives.

You may also want to expand the profile to include other types of foods, environmental allergens and medications. It is possible that your symptoms may be related to chronic urticaria-the recurrence of hive/urticaria for 6 weeks or more. There are a number of different possible causes including(1) physical causes (pressure, cold, sun, water, heat, exercise, pressure to the skin, stress), (2)associated with other illnesses-lupus, thyroid disease, infectionWhen you are reviewed by your doctor and additional testing done then it is possible the cause may be found.

What happens is that after taking these substances, they release chemicals in the blood which reach the brain through blood supply.

I do not cough during exercising","Hi, it could be possible to associate the cough to allergies, but I think other common causes of chronic cough must be evaluated. The first exam that will act as a triage is a chest X-ray. Infectious causes like pneumonia, pleurisy, aspergillus and some heart anomalies could lead to breathing difficulties. It is interesting to carry out a sputum exam especially with chronic coughs. Pulmonary Tuberculosis must be excluded in this examination, and presence of specific allergic bodies called Charcot Laden s bodies could suggest an allergic origin. Blood tests like measurement of Immunoglobulin E levels and a complete blood count, to show a rise in levels of Eosinophils to suggest an allergist origin. I suggest you visit your internist/pulmonologist for this allergic cause to be evaluated, and other common and serious respiratory tract infections like pulmonary tuberculosis be excluded.

I am so sorry about what you have been experiencing. I am not exactly sure if albuterol or allergies can explain these bad tastes you get once in a while when you cough hard.

I would suggest you to undergo skin prick test (SPT) for different allergens like pollen, mite, food and dust causing these symptoms, and you can identify them and protect yourself from exposing to these allergens. Otherwise, you can prefer immunotherapy either with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SUIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).

Levocetirizine is an anti histamine, which acts as an anti-allergic in controlling the acute episode. Montelukast acts as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Formonide (Formoterol + Budesonide) acts as bronchodilators and relieve breathing difficulty. If you do not consume the medications, their effect reduces & you get prone to acute allergic attacks. This condition is related to the hyper-sensitivity of your immune response. It can only be managed symptomatically.

Regarding activity - told 24 hours reduced level, not the recommended 48 hours we have since learned by looking up the procedure online - by Saturday afternoon, expecting to resume a normal activity level, went on a short bike ride to a local store. On the way home, noted a little more stiffness in the joint, but no other obvious problems, just a little more sore than usual, turned in early Saturday night. Tried to have a normal Sunday, by Sunday evening, noted an increased tightness in joint and top lateral shin area - had wife look at and massage leg/knee - she noted a golf-ball size effusion formed behind knee and that the adjacent veins were distended - no swelling in ankles or feet. The next day, nothing had changed, we assumed the fluid accumulation in the knee to be normal reaction to the injections, but reading said allergic reactions can happen and blood clots without obvious symptoms became a concern over the next couple days.

Bursae are pouches around knee both in back of knee in popliteal region and under collateral ligaments on sides of knee, occasionally a sub-patellar bursa may be communicating inner knee joint, but shin swelling or bursa is unlikely to communicate to inner joint where you got the shot, so no chance for seepage down to upper shin.

Due to exertion during swimming, bronchoconstriction i.e. narrowing of air passage/bronchioles occurs resulting in reflex in the form of cough. Antibiotic donor play a role unless there is added infection.  In bronchial asthma or in bronchitis, bronchodilators are needed as they dilate the constricted air passage and gives relief in cough. Bronchodilators can be given in the form of rota caps or inhaler as this route is safer and more effective. Antiallergy medicines like levocetrizine can be given to decrease the allergic reaction. Get them examined by a Pediatrician and give medicines under medical supervision only. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks.",1,antibiotic

It happens many times that a single person is allergic to more than one substance or one substance but that substance is used in many things, so it makes a person allergic to many things. As you now know that you are allergic to prawn, do not keep trying it as every time it will cause an allergic reaction and there are chances that it will increase in severity causing complications.

In addition, for the burned area inside the mouth, you can apply Endocrine Gel (McCoppin) 3-4 times a day. Applying it before meals will make consumption of food easier. Also, you should keep antihistamines such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) always at hand, so you can start it as soon as reaction starts to develop.

2009,"Hello, last summer I developed a few symptoms together. My upper lip swelled in the front(no sore, just swelling and irritation), my throat is very red, bumpy and irritated, and three canker sores on the inside of my mouth. After a week or so the canker sores healed and went away. My throat was irritated and continued to look bumpy and red for a couple months. Then winter came. My lip has remained swollen for about 8 months now and with the season turning and warmer weather coming around my throat is irritated again. This all developed after I kissed someone however after visiting a std clinic, an urgant care providor, and my primary physician I was reassured by all three that it is not an std. I was told by one that it was a viral infection and would clear up in a week or two and my primary physician told me it was allergies. Any Ideas?","Hello, I can understand your concern. Your symptoms do not suggest that you have any STD, thus you can stay relaxed about it. Your symptoms suggest more towards a viral infection, but as your doctor suggested, if it is a viral infection, it should resolve on its own in about a week and only supportive therapy related to symptoms might be needed. The persistent swelling for about 8 months seems to be an allergic reaction to a substance that you use routinely. However, in your case, it might be an allergic reaction along with the viral infection. I would recommend you to go for a blood test for allergy. It will suggest what substance you are allergic to so that you can avoid its exposure. After giving the blood for testing, you should start taking antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for about 10 days. If it will be an allergic reaction, the swelling should start to reduce or disappear. If that does not happen, then you should visit a dentist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon for examination of the lip and further investigations directed directly towards the lip swelling. Based on the results, diagnosis can be made and treatment can be advised. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,",1,None

Treatment for hirsutism won't allow you to get pregnant & vice versa. First decide your priority & accordingly get treated. Though Crimson might reduce hirsutism after 3-6 months of continuous treatment, it acts as contraceptive & pregnancy will not be possible. If hirsutism is your main concern & you don't want pregnancy right now, you can take the prescribed medicines. If pregnancy is your first priority, it's better to consult infertility specialist & get treated (& stop Crimson). Wish you good health.",1,None
2016,My son is 4 yrs old. He suffered from allergic bronchitis 2 months before. The doctor started l montus kid tablet and advised to continue for 6 months. I thought that continuos intake would result in somoe side effects. So I am giving him only when he is having problems. Is it ok? But within these 2 months he is getting running nose and throat pain again and again. He is having mild adenoid also. Please suggest me whether I have to give him Lmontus kid continuosly for 6 months,"Hi thanks for asking question... The tablet you are using can be helpful if taken prophylactically.... It will prevent release of inflammatory mediator esp.leukotrine if taken before allergen exposure.... So according to doctor advise take it.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns. The blood report you are showing me indicates a slightly elevated Eosinophil count. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories, and in the laboratory I work, the normal range is considered less than 350 cells per microliter (cells/MCL).

This comes up in red lumps, itchy areas that appear randomly at various parts of the body. Individual hives may disappear in a few hours to within a day but new ones appear. Chicken, seafood, chocolate can appear to cause an itch as these foods are high in histamine, the exact chemical that causes these urticaria lesions to appear. The condition may start with an infection, but proceeds well after the infection has cleared up. Long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like fexofenadine taken once daily along with cetirizine or Atari (very sedative) over 4-6 weeks help.

It started off with sneezing (I have no allergies)then it went to a sore throat always being tired,high fever,having no energy,and not being able to eat. When I went to the doctor they wanted to take blood work I never had a problem with it before but for some reason I passed out my blood pressure was low and I had a very high fever so they assumed I had pneumonia.I was given medication for this. A few days later I couldn t talk,walk sit stand or do anything without help. I had pain in my back and ribs and couldn t stand up straight. Finally I did many tests the day I went back to the doctor my temperature and blood pressure were almost normal they gave me medication for a kidney infection.

Well that's the past story, Since now you should focus on how to control the infection with pain and aches. Perform regular breathing exercises, oxygen is the major source of human body, human body can stay without water for 1 hour or more but without oxygen every second is important. Because one cannot live without oxygen. Also, breathing exercises have been divided into -1. Deep breathing2. Diaphragmatic breathing3. Pursed lip breathing4. Costal Breathing5. Abdominal breathing. Performing this exercises regular can help you further to maintain the metabolism and also the lung capacities, Also , you need to perform the core stability exercises and pelvic floor strengthening exercises to avoid any kidney issues in the future.

Lymph nodes swell up in response to infection so if you have any infection in your mouth, like cavities in the teeth or gum infection you can get swollen up nodes.

Why did I react to this when I have never had any previous allergies.","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint the symptoms of itchy hands and feet along with redness or flushing of face and swelling or hives along with allergic angioedema seems to be due to Allergic reaction as such symptoms are the most common presentation of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. In case if on both occasions when the symptoms appeared you have taken Omeprazole the symptoms seems to be due to allergic reaction to Omeprazole that is a Proton Pump Inhibitor. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist and get evaluated, and he can do a thorough clinical evaluation and also advise allergic tests like LAST test, Patch test, food challenge test to rule out the exact cause of the problem and treat you accordingly. As of now you can take anti allergic like Allegra or Ben Chat Doctor. . The best way to prevent an allergic attack is to avoid exposure to allergen and in case if it is something that you come in contact with frequently you can be advised Immunotherapy to reduce the severity of allergy symptoms.

2059,"Hi, Im a 27 year old man and early this morning, after only a few hours of sleep, I suddenly woke up feeling unable to breath properly, as if something was blocking my throat. In an effort to breathe I was doing this weird cough-like function, like 10 times, which didnt change the situation. I felt that only minimal or no air at all was allowed in. I had a bottle of water near me so I drank some and after that I was able to breathe better, though I dont know if thats what helped me. However I was somewhat scared since this has never happened to me before, so I went to the ER.There, the doctor did a few basic tests, heard my breathing, checked my throat, took my blood pressure and a blood sample for blood tests, mostly to see the oxygen levels, as well as a chest area x-ray, and asked me the usual questions, like if Ive been sick and taking any medication, which are both negative. He also asked me if I felt anything weird still and I said my throat was sore though it may have been just because of the effort it took to breathe earlier.The doctor found everything normal, my blood pressure was surprisingly good too since I usually have a little bit hypertension, so he sent me home and I was frankly relieved, though I didnt feel like going back to sleep, in the end I fell asleep. It has now been 5 hours since the incident, and my throat still feels sore and weird, perhaps more so than previously, so Im worried the episode will happen again.Other information the doctor asked me, in case you need it too, is if I smoke, which I dont personally though I live with chain smokers so the house is often full of smoke, if I have any known allergies, which I dont, to my knowledge, as I only remember having an episode like 10 years ago but we never figured out what it was that I reacted badly to, with rashes and itch all over my body at the time, and it has never happened since. Anyway, I also feel like I may be coming down with a fever now, though the doctor took my temperature as well and while I didnt ask how it was he didnt mention anything about it.So, what could this be, waking up unable to breathe, and still feeling sore after 5 hours despite the ER doctor finding everythingi n order?","I have read all your question in detail first I would like to ask you* do you have snoring?* frequent Nasal stuffiness/blockade ? I want to know this also because sudden awakening from sleep and feeling of sob may be due to sleep apnea as well .and of course your home environment (chain smokers) is also not good.

Apart from that I have a rash on my buttocks, have constant urinary tract infections and constantly urinate with a very week flow and quite often have top concentrate to urinate. I also have constant nasal drip thick mucus at the back of my throat every morning that causes me to vomit when trying to brush my teeth. I have mentioned all this to my doctor and have been to hospital and asked for the blood test but so far have been refused. I am being treated separately for all the symptoms. I am told allergies cause the mucus problems even though antihistamines nasal spray and such like do help a little it never eradicates it. urinary problems I am told is psychosomatic and pains in stomach are due to grumbling appendix.

I would like to tell you one thing about the treatment of allergy. The only effective treatment of Allergy is avoidance of allergen (Triggering factor). Any substance could be an allergen. Most common allergens for NASA bronchial allergy are dust and pollen. As far as the monteluKast is concerned - this is not useful in treating acute attack of allergy. It will help in reducing the frequency of allergic episodes. For it to be effective you might have to use it for years (2-3 Years). In very rare cases may have to be used for very long periods. Rota caps will give you instant relief but will not affect the recurrence of allergic episodes. The only definitive treatment as I have mentioned earlier is avoidance of allergen. Just list out all the possible allergens with which you experience allergy. Try to avoid those allergens. Try using a cloth mask while going out. Using newer antihistamines like Fexofenadine 120 mg (Allegra) will help you to counter acute attacks. Get your Blood Eosinophil count done. Based on the result. You can use some medicines like DEC (Di Ethyl carbamide) which reduces the eosinophils and will prevent recurrent attacks of nasobronchial allergy. But please discuss with your doctor before you start using DEC. Hope you got some solution. Wish you a healthy day Take care",1,"dust, pollen"

If I were your doctor, after a clinical examination, I would advise you for some routine blood tests like a CBC, LFT, Blood sugar, serum lipid profile, a serum amylase and lipase estimation and an ultrasound of abdomen, an x-ray chest, and an ECG to rule out problems related to biliary and pancreatic system and the cardio vascular system.

Because it is mucoid, it would not rip or tear, just as your described. Fever does not usually occur in allergies, so the presence of fever indicates that you have an infection. Likely an upper respiratory tract viral infection. Since the cough is productive, in addition to your normally cough and cold meds, you may also want to use a bucolic.

But allergy should be treated in stepwise manner first if your symptoms is for few months a year like 2-3 months then you start an antihistamine which you have to take daily at night. If your symptoms still persist then your start using steroid nasal spray, it has no side effect, and it controls the allergy very well, and you should start 2 weeks before your symptoms start. If this also does not cure you. Then get yourself tested for allergy, it is called skin prick test you will know what you are allergic to, then if possible you can avoid the allergen, or you can start treatment called immunotherapy.

I have to constantly battle to get it up to 97.5 and above to keep my kidneys working. I have continual spasms of all my organs, eyes, throat, back and chest, legs. My spine feels like it is on fire. All labs come back normal, including T3 and T4 and TSH. My tongue is huge, my face swells at will, I have stiffness in my legs and back. I have increasing low back and leg weakness. My legs go completely numb, tingling, cold from the knees down. I think its the hardware or the donor bone. I have multiple chemical sensitivity to alcohol, alcohol by-products or medical products that alcohol is used to process it. Also any medications or medical implants that may be enteric coated.

My legs are too weak to control. I can t drive any more.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. MRI is an investigation of choice to study the spinal cord, intervertebral discs and nerves. It is important that you confirm that the metal hardware is MRI compatible. This is because the MRI machine is a huge magnet and if the hardware is not MRI compatible then you might have serious injury during MRI scan. This happens when there is ferromagnetic properties in the metal which will attract the hardware. This might cause the hardware to get pulled from its fixed location and cause injury to surrounding structures.  It is also possible that you have an MRI compatible hardware and if this holds good then there is no need to worry about any problems in MRI scan. Then your MRI imaging will be safe and the causes for your pain and discomfort can be evaluated in more detail than a CT scan.",1,"alcohol, metal"

You need to observe that after what specific things does sneezing occurs. This will tell you that you are allergic to what specific thing and then try to avoid it. If its soap then change brand. Acne usually occurs on face. What you have on back could be militia, but that needs a dermatological examination to confirm it. Treatment for it will be given by dermatologist after examination. If its militia then its main cause is hot weather. For recurrent allergy I would suggest you to take montelukast one daily for one month. Research has shown that it decreases the allergic symptoms considerably. Hope this answers your question.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. There are many factors contributing to development of respiratory allergy in a child.

If indicated, he may suggest specific allergen immunotherapy to your son which works on immune system to treat the allergy. Regarding age of cure, it depends on type of asthma.

2164,"I have never had allergies before, up until this year (some sinus issues on and off, but nothing major). About 4 months ago I had a few episodes were my eyes got very itchy and dry on and off and a few times I had some eye symptoms...minor swelling of the right upper eyelid , twice had a bubble which looked like a mosquito bite form under the eye (one time each eye) and another time I woke up with small to medium size bag under my left eye. Each time I felt fine other than the small amount of swelling and each time it was only in one eye, never both. In fact, most times I didn t realize until I went and looked in the mirror and then got scared after seeing the small amount of swelling. I also saw an eye doctor last fall after the first issue with it and the covering of my left eyeball was slightly fluid filled, which he said was due to an irritant and nothing to worry about. We had also found some black mold in our basement at that time that a plumber opened up the ceiling (so conceivably, some of these mold spores may have come out into the air...I had had no issues before this). I am now about 120 pounds (was 140 before I lost the weight) and female and 45 years old. I am a very nervous person and had been under severe stress for several months. It was during this time I started getting the eye symptoms. So stress, the mold issue and most likely the start of peri- menopause may all be contributing. Two of times I got the eye symptoms I had eaten peanut butter....but many hours beforehand. One time it was probably between 4-6 hours earlier and the second time, it was about 10-12 hours earlier. I had also had peanut butter in between with no symptoms. Each time I felt fine other than later on getting some eye symptoms. I had also, due to the stress, had lost 20 pounds during those months and once became dehydrated. Both times I had gotten the little bump under my eye (like a mosquito bite), I had been under acute stress both those days. Those are the only 2 times that ever happened. My general physician feels it s all stress-related and also seasonal allergies (I seem to have a little bit of hayfever). He said my symptoms are not consistent with food allergy or peanut butter allergy. Since not having any peanut products, I ve had no eye swelling, bags or bumps, but my stress level is also a LOT lower now. Should I get a blood allergy test for peanuts or is it most likely stress-related or hormone-related? Is it just a coincidence? Whenever I ve eaten peanut butter I always feel absolutely fine afterwards...even relaxed. No other symptoms...no rash, no breathing issues, nothing else. Being the nervous person I am though, I have worried that if the eye symptoms were related to the peanut butter, then my reaction could be worse next time. That s my main fear in trying the peanut butter again (as I said, I had been suffering anxiety and panic for several months, so my thought process became a little skewed). Would love to know if it s safe to just try the peanut butter again or if I should have the blood test. Thank you.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. I think you should get yourself tested for an allergy to peanuts. Its unlikely that stress or hormonal issues are contributing to these allergies.

What can I do, Please? Debra","Dear Debra, Are your symptoms only itchy earlobes or red eyes, runny nose, itchy nose, cough and itchy earlobes? If it is the former (i.e., ear itchy only) then you may wish to consider if this is secondary to metal allergy like earrings or jewelry. Nickel allergy is quite common that is a hypersensitivity (delayed rather than immediate) and can last for quite long and flares up on little contact again. Patch test procedure can diagnose chemical (delayed) hypersensitivities. If you have all the symptoms, then dust mite or pollen allergy is more likely. Skin prick or specific IGE (blood test) can reveal all the allergies but needs to be discussed with a Specialist in Allergy. Combination of oral antihistamines and nasal sprays are required and occasionally leukotriene antagonists for a longer duration of benefit. Thanks.",1,"metal, nickel, dust, mite, pollen"

2171,"hi , my name is Pamela & I got my belly piercing about a month ago . my belly piercing grew a keloid and i started putting garlic and olive oil to cure it. when the keloid got smaller , I decided to put a little more but then it cut me a little. i then put aspirin on it and now i got an allergic reaction. the top hole of my belly piercing is extremely red and bumpy and i dont know what to do to cure it. how can i cure it and how long will take for this to go away?",Hi. Thanks for the query. Allergic reaction to aspirin at the site of allergic reaction is due to inflammation caused at the site of reaction. The allergic reaction can be treated by taking antihistamines like Clarity or Ben Chat Doctor. . Keep the area of the piercing clean and apply steroid based ointment on it in order to reduce inflammation and bump. In case of pain you can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen or Advil. You can apply numbing gel containing lidocaine or choline salicylate over the inflamed area for relief from pain. Do not remove or change the jewelry you are wearing over the belly piercing till the area heals and becomes painless. Do cold compresses not directly by placing ice but wrapping ice in a clean and,1,ibuprofen
2172,I recently at a stuffed mushroom and it contained feta cheese and I literally woke up about 30 minutes with hives and welts from scratching everywhere. I itch so bad it woke me up. I have since taken 3 Benadryl pills but I still itch. Should I wake my boyfriend up to go to the ER. And my tongue feels alittle sick. I have never been allergic to anything except flagyl.,"HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It would be best to be seen as soon as possible in the ER or your emergency doctor if your tongue is swelling. This can affect breathing and may indicate that you may have a very severe allergic response that would not respond to Ben Chat Doctor. In the ER, you may need steroids as well. You would need to avoid this allergen in the future. If you are not sure if it is the mushrooms or cheese then either avoid both or do allergy tests. I hope this helps",1,mushrooms
2173,"I ve had a recurrent rash for several weeks. My family practice doctor treated me for scabies which I knew I did not have. I have no none food allergies and have stopped eating and drinking everything that I think could be a contributing cause. Oddly, I had been craving tomato juice for weeks and couldn t get enough. That has passed. Also have been experiencing some odd discomfort at the base of my skull that seems to coincide with a weird sensation in my arms and hands. This has been going on for about six weeks. The rash seems to worsen during the evening with no triggers and is helped by lotion. The rash is more like welts than prickly heat and is not a wet rash. It is not hives; I ve had the reaction to shrimp. I don t like taking antihistamines and hence have not. Thanks.","Hello, If the rash that you describe is red, itchy, has raised skin that you can feel, goes away after a few hours only for new ones to appear in their place, does not leave a mark or bruise, then this is acute urticaria. That you have had it for >6 weeks, makes it chronic urticaria. 80% of people with urticaria do not have allergy, although a pre-existing allergy to (say) house dust mite, pollen or shrimp does not make it more likely for this type of urticaria to appear. Infections, underlying thyroid problems, diabetes, inflammation inside the body (can be several conditions, say endometriosis) and stress makes these lesions appear and can last quite long. The treatment (that you don't like) is the right one, long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like Allegra 180\u00a0mg once in the morning, and cetirizine 10\u00a0mg at lunchtime or evening for 6 weeks (max 3 months). Unless you continue on high dose antihistamines, this will recur. If you think you may have a thyroid problem, get TSH fT4 and TPO antibodies tested. If there is a chance of an infection, please get this checked and treated as well. I hope this helps. Best Wishes.",1,"shrimp, dust, mite, pollen"

My name is Rachel and I am a 30 year old female.,"Hello Rachel, Food allergy with lip tingling and swelling (angioedema) is likely provided you get the feeling immediately after eating the offending food. Any foods can cause this, but has to be almost immediately or within the hour. Blood pressure pills such as enalapril, captopril, trandolapril, lisinopril etc., so please ensure your current medications are checked with your doctor if you are on any. If now food allergies are unlikely, then this is idiopathic angioedema, and you need to be on cetirizine 10\u00a0mg once daily for 1 month to see if this recurs. If it still recurs on antihistamine, please get complement proteins C3 C4 level checked. Best Wishes.",1,None

2179,"Is it normal to have a swollen lymph node for 6 months? Hi, I am a 20 years old female. I have had a painless lump or swollen lymph node that has been in my neck for six 6 months now since December 2010 that can only be felt, but not seen. The lymph node is no bigger than the size of a half a dime and feels like a swollen kidney bean that keeps changing in size from small to big and then smaller again, but it never fully goes away. In terms of texture I cant tell if its firm, soft or hard. Its hard to tell. Anyway, I finally went to my doctor in early April 2011 to get it checked out and he put me on a weeks worth of antibiotics, and prescribed me some allergy and asthma medication. He also did a chest X-ray and blood test that came back normal. When I went back to my doctor he said that the lymph node had shrunk and that was a good sign and that it might have really been an infection. So he told me to observe it for a month and come back to check it out and if its still there he will send me for a biopsy. So far the lymph node is STILL there and it feels like it enlarged back a little, but that might be because I keep picking at it from worrying so much. So far I dont have any symptoms of fevers, night sweats, fatigue, persistent itching, or unexplained weight loss, in fact I gained ALOT of weight from anxiety and stress eating from the fear of this being lymphoma or some other cancer. Lastly, I think its in the posterior triangle area of my neck not sure of diagram of lymph nodes. Is it normal for a lymph node to be swollen for 6 months?","Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor. I understand your concern and situation. You are having chronic lymphadenitis. Lymphadenitis occurs when the glands become enlarged by swelling (inflammation), often in response to bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The swollen glands are usually found near the site of an infection, tumor, or inflammation. Prompt treatment with antibiotics usually leads to a complete recovery. It may take weeks, or even months, for swelling to disappear. Sometimes it is seen that lymph nodes respond to treatment but with recurring throat infection there is changing sizes. You can get evaluation done by ultrasound guided FNAC or biopsy for AFB, culture sensitivity test for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, cytology. This will clear your doubts. Take care.",1,antibiotic

Chicken pox classically presents with red lesions which later on become topped with fluid filled lesions. The lesions of chicken pox are mainly distributed on the trunk, face and proximal extremities. Palms and soles are usually spared. Fever and other systemic symptoms are present. I will suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist after examination would be able to either confirm or rule out chicken pox.
