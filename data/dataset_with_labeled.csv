3,I have been sick for few months now. I had hives on my face first and then my lymph nodes got swollen and it hurted. I started having breathing problems and I still have breathing problems scince then. My tonsils are swollen too. I had periods 2 times in january of this year. And i have geogrophical tongue. its still there. I dont know what could it be? when I go to doctor they tell me its an allergy.,"Hi! Geographical tongue is usually related to glossies, however, there are some instances that yeast overgrowth in the stomach can cause tonsils, pain in the submandibular lymph nodes/ pain and lymph adenopathy and later on will result to glossies. As we know that yeast can grow in an acidic environment and sugar-laden environment. However, there are several causes that the tongue may swell and that could be caused by allergens, nutritional deficiencies and/ or infections. If the swelling of your tongue/ glossies/ geographic tongue is caused by allergens then probably that is also the cause of your hives on the face. We need to treat the cause of your geographic tongue, if you think it is from yeast overgrowth in the stomach, then, a diet modification will do. Like avoiding acidic foods and beverages, avoiding cheese, nuts or those foods that is high in sugar and at the same time a probiotic Chat Doctor.  If you think it is caused by allergy then avoiding all the foods and allergens is the mainstay of prevention, and at the same time taking an antihistamine",1,cheese,Food

The causes maybe various-food items, dust, pollen, outdoor plants, any recent outdoor activity, new cosmetics or jewelry(earrings), also could be due to sun exposure which may have aggravated an allergy.

Take a course of antihistamines like fexofenadine daily for a week. If the rash is severe apply a light layer of fluticasone cream at night for a week and stop. During the day you can use a soothing lotion with calamine/aloe vera for the face. Use a gentle cleanser. If it persists inspire of treatment consult your dermatologist.

Welcome to Ask A Doctor.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  A side effect of Motrin(ibuprofen) is to cause stomach inflammation which can make the stomachs inside lining bleed. The blood is carried along with intestinal contents through the entire intestinal tract.  By the time it reaches the end it is black and makes stool black.  Blueberries, Pepto-Bismol, and iron supplements also make stool black.  A hive rash is an allergic rash and could be due to Motrin, especially if the hives appeared very soon after you gave him the dose.  Tylenol does not irritate the stomach and is safer.  Hard stool is usually due to not enough liquid intake.  You may want to try giving apple and pear juices.  If that doesn't help, prune juice, 1-2ounces one-two times per day might be beneficial.  Frequent colds and coughing could be from being in close contact with other young child Chat Doctor.  How old is your child?  Does he attend daycare?  Also, cold and cough syrups are NOT recommended to give to child",1,motrin,Drug

If you have allergy only during 3-4 four months time then you should start with antihistamine tablets. See for the results if there is no improvement then you have to go to the next step that is nasal steroid sprays. You have to start steroid nasal spray 3-4 weeks before your symptoms start. It gives very good results. If these sprays do not work then you have to undergo allergy test, an immunologist will do skin prick test to find out your allergic to what all substances. Once it is identified you will have to take immunotherapy. This I can assure will cure your allergy to up to 80-90 percent.

If you have throat irritation, I would additionally suggest you warm saline gargles upon awakening and before going to sleep. All above measures will work towards your relief of symptoms. For allergy, the basic cause of your symptoms, I would suggest you to consult an ALlergist-Immunologist who will perform allergy testing and help you identify the substances you are allergic to.

It seems that you have allergies to more than one substance, and you do not exactly know what substances are acting as allergens for you. Thus, firstly, I would recommend you to go for a blood test for allergy. It will show in results what food and environmental substances are acting as allergen for you and so you can be alert in your day-to-day routine regarding exposure to these substances and avoid yourself from exposure. This is the best precaution you can take. In addition, you can also keep antihistamine such as Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) or Cetirizine 5 mg (Exocet) all the time with you so that as soon as the reaction starts, you can take the medicine immediately and control the reaction. Also, if you are allergic to more than one substance that you can be exposed to routinely, you can talk with your physician about taking an antihistamine regularly as hypertension patients take antihypertensives.

28,"Help! I have urticaria on my buttocks and thighs - humidity and tight pants might be a factor. I first noticed the red irregular bumps on my buttocks about 4 years ago in the summer after returning from the beach/ pool. I continued to get it every summer since after sunbathing; it lasts for 2 to 3 weeks and then it goes away. This year however, I got it in February (I was pregnant at the time) and its been coming back on and off in small bumps since then. I finally saw a dermatologist who did a biopsy; the diagnosis- papular urticaria. In hope for an answer, I saw an allergist as well - turns out im allergic to dust mites and cockroach (not known to cause hives). Yesterday I went to a hot yoga class; the room was warmer than usual and i sweated profusely. I got home and my right thigh was covered in red bumps of different sizes, some even expended into a massive red area overnight - they are somewhat itchy and my skin feels as sensitive as when I get sunburn.

What steps should i take?","Hello friend, I am a Homeopath and so my answer will be different from what you have already heard about allergy. Yes you are allergic to several things like heat of summer, dust, mites, cockroach etc. This hypersensitivity is inborn or genetic. But the time of developing hypersensitivity is related usually to a psychological conflict you had at the time of onset of the problem. If you started getting it 4 years back, exactly before that you must have had some shocking conflict which remain unresolved. But your brain associated the urticaria to the external environments like heat of sun, dust etc. instead of associating with the conflict. Now your brain has made a program associated with these factors and whenever you get exposed to such environments you get the symptoms of urticaria. First if you can recollect the conflict, then you can resolve it at the mental level. How you reacted to that is important because that is your genetic, constitutional individuality that made you to react in that manner. This will help the Homeopathic physician to select the constitutional remedy for you. Therefore, my advice to you is to approach an expert Homeopath at the earliest. You should stop taking any anti- Chat Doctor.  Once you are cured, then your urticaria will go away. With best wishes,",1,dust,Environmental

If this does not improve your nasal symptoms, I would suggest taking intranasal corticosteroid spray for 1-2 weeks.

I would also suggest washing your eyes with clean water 3-4 times a day, that will help in addition. Levocetirizine and montelukast will also work for skin symptoms. For identification of allergy causing allergens, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise you allergy testing and help to identify the allergen. Common allergens are apart from house dust mites, molds, pollen, animal dander, cockroach and other insects, etc. As general measures, I would suggest you to avoid dusts, smokes and air pollutants as much as possible.

Summer/spring allergies are fairly common due to more dust, pollen in the air, as well as sun. Since you are unable to narrow down the cause, I would advise you to take precautions during this season. Wear comfortable cotton clothing, covering as much skin as possible. Avoid midday sun exposure. Always use a sunscreen. Wash hands, face when you come back from outdoor activity. Shower with warm water and apply a good moisturizer immediately after like Detail DAM or an intensive moisturiser. Avoid fragrances and strong chemicals in soap, lotions. When you have active rashes try to avoid commonly allergy causing items like nuts, seafood etc.Also, during rashes take an antihistamine tablet once daily like fexofenadine and apply calamine lotion over the area when irritation occurs. In case of severe redness or actively spreading rash in the summer, use a fluticasone cream for about a week over the rashes and stop. Continue the other tips advised. You can consult a dermatologist regarding certain skin allergy tests and blood tests which can point out the substances you are allergic to. Hope this helps.",1,"dust, pollen",Environmental

58,hello doctor! i got my CBC report today. it says mild eosinophilia. my eosinophil counts are 480cumm. I am allergic to dust and i sneeze and have running nose everyday in the morning. What can be the possible cure and will multivitamin tablets would be of any help?,"HIT hanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor.  See you are having high eosinophils due to you're allergic. This condition is called Atop. This is a hereditary condition where your body produces excess of Eosinophils in response to dust / Smoke / Cold Air or certain food or medicines.  The best possible cure is avoidance of the allergen, dust in your case.  Apart from avoidance there is one more modality of treatment called Allergen Desensitization. In this condition first you will be tested for what dust you are allergic and once that is found you will be injected small but incremental quantities of dust over a period of 6 months. But this procedure is used only is serious cases.  Multivitamins will not help. Take more of Pomegranate, ginger and black pepper.  Also ask for Montelukast+ cetirizine medication prescription, and you can use it whenever sneezing is too much. Hope this information was useful to you. Any clarifications feel free to ask.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I think you have food allergy related to non-veg diet and what we call \""solar urticaria\"". Talking about food allergy, it is very important to know your symptoms related to consumption of food. Usually they are immediate itching, rash, swelling after consumption of food. If it is so, I would suggest you to avoid the food you are allergic to for at least 6 months. Afterwards you can try to eat in small quantity to see whether you react. If you are not sure exactly to which non-veg food you are allergic to, I would suggest you to observe closely your diet and symptoms. Most common non-veg foods causing allergy are fish, shell fish, eggs, etc. Regarding sun allergy (solar urticaria), I would suggest you to take daily levocetirizine and montelukast for a month & use a good sunscreen lotion. Please protect your skin from direct exposure to sunlight. Vitamin A rich food like carrots, mango, green leafy vegetables will also help. Stress/tension can aggravate allergies, so I would recommend you daily relaxation and meditation. This will help you in a long run. Hope this will be useful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,"fish, eggs",Food
89,my son is dust allergic and he coughs in the evening when he sleeps. if his head position is kept little higher he stops coughing. at present he is taking montair plus kid one tablet every evening from last 1 and a half month and furaspray nasal spray. what to do doctor his cough is repetedly coming?,"Hi, As per your query, your child has symptoms of recurring cough which is due to upper respiratory tract infection leading to bronchitis/granular pharyngitis. Need not worry. Already he is taking so much of medication still not getting affected, I would suggest you do warm saline gargles and take steam twice a day. Avoid the use of sharp and spicy food substances. Avoid cold carbonated beverages. Your symptoms will resolve in 1 week. If symptoms keep on persisting you should consult Pediatrician once and take proper treatment. You should get an X-ray chest done along with pulmonary function tests. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics (amoxicillin or penicillin) along with decongestants. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",1,dust,Environmental

Are others around presenting with same symptoms? Is it the first time you are experiencing this? Any fever or lymph node enlargement? A careful evaluation could really be needed. A food allergy is a possibility, but the spread is really unusual. It should be interesting to know the duration of time between consuming alcohol or pee nuts and developing the rash. If it occurred immediately after, it could be incriminated. But if not, other sources should be searched for. Characteristic lesion should easily guide the clinician, depending on whether the rashes are vesicles, pustules, males or pa pules and other clinical parameters, an appropriate diagnosis could easily be made. Booking an appointment with your family physician or dermatologist could be of interest. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD.",1,peanut,Food

The allergens like dust, food, pollen and mites will stimulate the mast cells to release histamine which is the marker of allergy and produces these weird symptoms of generalized hives. As your doctor has prescribed the antihistamines and the steroid which helps to control the symptoms but prolong use of celesta min should be discouraged as it has its own side effects. I would suggest you to identify the allergen causing these symptoms by undergoing skin prick test (SPT) and avoid exposing to these allergens. Otherwise, you can prefer immunotherapy either with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SUIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Thank you.",1,"dust, pollen",Environmental

126,Ive had a dry cough for 4 weeks along with dry and sore nasal lining. Throat is itchy and requires me to cough to remove the itch. No problem sleeping or any cold symptoms. CBC and diff all normal. Humidity at work is 22%. Had an ENT look at throat and nose lining and said it was perhaps a new allergy to something in my house. Cough occurs every 10 min or so during the day. Should I wait it out and just drink a lot of water or go see my family physician ?,"Hello, Runny nose, sneezing, nasal discharge (usually white), cough are signs of an allergic process. Once the rhinitis goes beyond control and affects the airways, you develop breathing difficulties as in asthma. That the CBC is normal, suggests the eosinophil count is also normal, that would exclude severe allergies. However, house dust mite or fungal allergies are common at this time of the year. I would suggest long-acting antihistamines like cetirizine 10\u00a0mg (maximum twice daily) and/or a nasal spray like Flonase 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 1 month and see the benefit. If things worsen after you stop, please get a blood test or skin prick test (must stop all antihistamines for at least 1 week if skin tests are required) to exclude allergic triggers.

In my opinion your son is having pneumonia, and he is not responding to the treatment as he developed coughing again. So better to get done repeat chest x-ray.

154,"Can Bronchitis be caused by dust AND allergies not involve coughing? I was working around some amorphous silica dust Diatomaceous earth for a few weeks at a farm, NOT the crystalline kind which is super bad though. Had no idea what I was really working with till I looked it up after 4 weeks of working around it. So I got away from it and not around it now. Right after getting away however the pollen has gotten bad and I m feeling rather short of breath and slight pain in the bronchial tubes , BUT almost no coughing, almost no flem and no wheezing. Did not have these issues while around the dust on the farm, just after. What might I have, and what is the best thing to do? How quick can I expect it to go away?

Eyes discharge and itching constitutes allergic rhinoconjonctivities. Respiratory symptoms also fall into this allergic table. It would be important to know whether there is any family history of allergy of asthma. Doing a serum Immunoglobulin E and complete blood counts to search for increased eosinophils could be important. Getting a chest X-ray and peak flow to access the asthma state. Treatment ranges from local anti histamines and steroids. Systemic steroids and antihistamines could also be used, and the treatment could go for a year or two depending on the response. Other conditions that need being excluded are aspergilli. Consulting a neurologist for a proper evaluation and treatment could e very important.

As allergy has already ruled out, other possible causes are sinus problem or vasomotor rhinitis. Consult ENT doctor for examination, Nasal endoscopy is useful to check for sinus, once sinus problem is ruled out, other probable cause is vasomotor rhinitis, which is basically due to dilatation of blood vessel in nose causing symptoms. Saline nasal spray, decongestants are useful, If your symptoms are not controlled with these measures then corticosteroid nasal sprays, antihistamine nasal sprays useful. Correction of any deviated septum, if present, is helpful in avoiding recurrence. If you are able to identify what causes your symptoms it may be possible to avoid these triggers, such as perfumes, secondhand smoke, dust, etc. Avoiding these triggers will reduce your symptoms and discomfort. You should also avoid overusing nasal decongestants. Hope this helps you. Regards",1,dust,Environmental

However, it would be good to rule out causes of itches especially given the fact that this particular itches as you said have been a problem since a month now and at night. Accumulation of certain substances in the body due to their not being able to be excreted can also cause such itches. This is common when the gall bladder which uses bile to excrete toxins from the body has some issues. So kindly see a physician for lab test especially for the gall bladder to rule out other causes other than allergies. Check to see if something AHS changed too in your diet or bed or what you use to ensure It's not simply some allergy. However, it would be good to see a physician to rule out some other cause such as gall bladder malfunction. Hope this helps. Quick recovery and regards, Chat Doctor.",1,dust,Environmental

I would suggest you to keep a note of each and every food your daughter consumes with time and date and also note the time and date of symptoms. Please note ingredients of each food items too. Your keen observation will help you to identify the food causing allergic symptoms. I would like to let you know that most common foods causing allergy are - milk, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, shellfish, fish & meat. However, it is possible to have allergy for any of the foods, so food diary is indeed a handy tool. Rast tests are used for diagnosis of food allergy, but they are not 100%. It is possible to have a negative Last test despite having allergy to food and also vice versa. Also, sometimes a child can have non-allergic reaction to a food, which cannot be picked up in laboratory tests. If this approach does not lead you to any conclusion, I would suggest you to consult an allergist-immunologist, who will ask you in very much detail and may suggest you some investigations. He may also advise you to keep a food diary. Hope this will help you. Wish your daughter the best of the health. Regards.",1,nut,Food

Thanks.","Hi, you do seem to have allergy due to dog dander. Allergy is usually not related to breed of dog. You must be allergic to all dogs dander. I think it is best for you to avoid contacts with dog. If you cannot then I suggest you go to and immunologist and get your self tested for animal dander allergy, that way you will be sure your allergic to dog dander, and also you can start treatment for it. You will have to take immunotherapy which will surly reduce your symptom .but it's a long treatment (4yr) and expensive also. I suggest you avoid dog keeping dog it is more practical.

183,"Hello, I am wondering if I should go and see a doctor. I am staying with my inlaws right now and as soon as we arrived 6 days ago I got some sort of rash on the inside of my arms. It appeared after I had a nap on their fold out bed. Although I dont seem to have any allergies I do often have itchy eyes, a runny nose and sneezing when I sleep there. Now I dont have any of those symptoms but I do have the rash which itches intensely and it seems to be getting worse. It now looks like I have mosquito bites all up the inside of my arms, around my armpits and up the sides of my torso. My back is also itchy as well as my tummy and under my breasts but there are not as many visible spots. Does this sound like an allergic reaction or could it be something contagagious? Should I go to the doctor since I have had this for 6 days? Besides the itching I am not really affected. Thank you","Hello, Thank you for writing to us. House dust mite allergy is a likely possibility given the itchy eyes, runny nose and sneezing. Urticaria can happen (itchy hives) sometimes due to the dust allergy but usually unrelated. You will need skin prick tests or specific IGE blood test to find out what your allergies are (aeroallergen panel). Long acting antihistamines like cetirizine 10\u00a0mg or fexofenadine 180\u00a0mg plus Flonase nasal spray 2 spray/nostril twice daily is recommended for severe house dust mite allergy. You will need to take both for at least 2 months to have a good effect. The antihistamines will also work for the urticaria. I hope that was useful. Best Wishes.",1,mosquito,Insect

Your hives may or may not be related to your alcohol intake (especially if it occurs right after Chat Doctor.

It may be infective or obstructive (secondary to stones or tumor lesions) in origin.

I experienced rapid heart beat last night after I ate fried fish and red spots occurred all over my body and I felt like my head was so hot that it seems like its going to burst. Everything went back to normal after I drink soft drinks (sprite). My parents gave me anti-allergy medicine but I was afraid to take it because It might make it worst. I also experienced this last week, after eating dried fish. I am 22 years old now, and when i was in Grade 5, i had an asthma attack. I cannot breath air and was taken in ICU after I ate Tuna Fish. Only those times I have those kind of reactions but most of the time nothing happens if i eat any kind of fish. Do you think I am allergy to fish, doc? What kind of allergy is it? If it will happen again next time, will it be a threat to my life?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. As you are not experiencing symptoms every time you eat fish, first I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather than fish allergy. Histamine fish poisoning is a relatively common type of food poisoning. It occurs after consumption of improperly preserved or inadequately refrigerated fish (Fish require stringent refrigeration for preservation). It occurs due to presence of excess of a substance called histamine in the fish. The symptoms are the ones you described - skin rash, itching, headache, palpitation, sometimes breathlessness, etc. The symptoms develop within a few minutes of consumption of fish and usually subside by 6, rarely last up to 12 hours. A very important thing to know is that it is not possible to know whether the fish is likely to cause histamine poisoning by look or even taste of the fish. It looks and tastes same. Only sometimes one feels a typical peppery or burning taste in mouth while consuming fish, one can suspect it is rich in histamine and one should not consume it. Usually antihistamines medications like chlorpheniramine and sanitizing are used for treatment of symptoms. So, in your case, I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather fish allergy. It is even more common wish some variety of fish like Tuna, Sardine, Mahi-mahi, etc. It is not an allergy. Furthermore, it is usually benign and self-limited, but rarely it can cause death. If you experience any serious symptom like difficulty in breathing, dizziness, palpitation, etc. it is advisable to go to ER and get examined by physician and treated. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",1,fish,Food

Your history does seem to resemble that of allergic rhinitis which is common in child Chat Doctor.

213,"Hello, Recently I developed this allergy 6 months ago, where my face turns red with hives . This only happens when I eat strawberries, berries, pineapples, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers or any food similar to it. Also when I use any cosmetics were it contains glitter or when I use lipsticks closer to red tones I develop this hive, but when I use eyeliner, face powder containing no glitter, nothing happens. I only develop this hive the day after I eat or use these cosmetics. First symptoms, my face would turn red and it will feel itchy. Then a few hours later, my face will become swollen around the eye area. I used to be able to eat and use this product with no problem, I don t know what trigger my body to develop this allergy to certain products. Any idea what is going on? Thank you","Hello, The symptoms you describe and the relation to foods does seem consistent with urticaria that can be triggered in some people by foods rich in salicylates. Urticaria is a condition when mast cells in the skin release histamine after simple triggers such as scratching (physical), but also to temperature change (such as hot shower or cold-induced urticaria), stress, infections etc. Foods high in salicylates can also trigger and the foods you mention do fall in that category. Long-acting antihistamines such as Allegra 180\u00a0mg once daily for 3 months should be tried to see the effect. Removing foods high in salicylates as a trial for a maximum period of 4 weeks is recommended, but no longer if there has no obvious effect. If there is evidence of tree or grass pollen allergy, then these can act as secondary triggers. You can visit the patient information website allergy.or.uk for more information on salicylates if you wish. Hope that helps. Best Wishes.",1,pollen,Environmental

For allergic bronchitis you may ask your doctor to add long acting bronchodilator nebulization like Foretell or Albuterol which may prevent recurrent episodes of wheezing, oral antihistamines, montelukast and bucolic combinations which prevent allergic response and helps in clearing chest of secretions. Episodes of cough, wheezing, chest congestion occur due to exposure to an allergen. You will need to identify what is triggering such episodes. It may be allergens like pollen, dust, mite etc., Sometimes chemicals like perfumes, mosquito repellents etc. Adequate treatment may not be as effective if exposure to allergens is continued.

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint the first thing that has to be taken care of in case of Allergic Rhinosinusitis is that you should get ruled out for the exact cause for allergic reaction and once it is ruled out the first thing that you should do is t avoid exposure to the allergen.

242,"I was just diagnosed with being allergic to cat and dogs.  We had a cat in our house the past 3 years.  We found a new cat for our home so we got rid of the problem.  Im taking Allegra and steriod nasal spray but still experiencing congestion. I did have a CT scan and it show that my inferior turbinates are enlarged.  Is this due to being allergic to our cat?  Will my inferior turbinates get back to normal in a few weeks or months once the dander is out of our home?  If yes, how long will it take?","Hi Welcome to Chat Doctor, Swollen turbinates with sneezing, watering eyes with runny nose could be due to rhinitis (allergic or infective) or acute sinusitis. Here, it can be mostly due to either allergy or viral infection because of our low immunity or allergic to certain substances like dust, pollens or grass. You should take symptomatic treatment,1) Take antibiotics (quinolones like ofloxacin or accolades like azithromycin) to prevent super-infection.2) Take antiallergic Chat Doctor. 3)Take decongestants like phenylephrine if you have congestive symptoms in turbinates, nose and throat.4) Steroid nasal spray like rhinoceros, flonase or became.5) Nebulization twice daily with saline or take steam inhalation 2 to 3 times a day. The best way to cure allergy is to avoid contact with the allergen, so you can make out which particular substance from these cats or dogs is causing it and try to avoid contact it. If still problem persists then you should consult ENT specialist who can recommend you certain blood tests with ESR and X-ray of face to make a diagnosis clear. Hope this information will help you. If still any query then you can ask me.",1,dogs,Pet

I cant stop itching. am I allergic to all foods... ??? please someone help me..","Hello Lisa, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. There are two types of allergy tests - skin prick test (which you have been undergone) and serum tests (Immunogen or LAST). I suggest you not to be worried by test results. These tests are not 100%. They only complement a clinicians decision about diagnosis of your food allergy. If you are demographic, skin testing will give you what we call false positives (means even if test is positive you are not allergic to it). So in a demographic person, skin testing is not a reliable test. So forget the results of skin test if you are demographic!! Diagnosis of food allergy requires a very detailed history about your symptoms & your diet, right from very beginning when you had your first allergy symptoms. This requires a detailed consultation. After suspecting the foods you may be allergic to, you may be advised serum allergy tests to support the diagnosis. The best diagnosis of food allergy is by food challenge which is done at specialized allergy centers. I would suggest you to keep a food diary in which you can keep note of food taken (including ingredients) and every symptom you developed, with time & date. This will help you and your doctor to suspect what is it that may be causing symptoms. Common food allergies are milk, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, fish & shellfish. But one can be allergic to any other food substances from routine diet. Also, I should tell you that there are other gastrointestinal disorders which may mimic food allergy and there is food intolerance (in simple words it means one cannot tolerate some foods) also. A gastroenterologist consultation would be helpful to you if you don't have food allergy. So I would suggest you not to think that you are allergic to all foods! Also, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine (levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine) and montelukast daily to control your symptoms. Wish you best of the health.

Early morning sneezing is also a sign of chronic allergy and some simple things to do over a few weeks would help you. Avoid dust exposure as much is possible, cover nostrils & mouth when be in a dusty situation.

If so avoid this. For blacked nose take steam two-three times daily. Start breathing exercises.deep breath.hold.and release slowly. Many times daily.

The commonest cause in tropical countries is parasite infections, and antiparasitic treatment is recommended after stool culture studies. This is a must before going through unnecessary tests or treatments. If the eosinophil count remains high and sneezing and rhinoconjuncitivitis symptoms persist, it would suggest allergies as the underlying cause. Pollen allergy, smoke (industrial) are major factors that need high dose antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. The duration of treatment will depend on the trigger (i.e., seasonal vs perennial [all year around]). There are several other causes but infections, allergies and rarely autoimmune diseases are causes of raised eosinophil counts.

The symptoms described you indicate that your son is probably having uncontrolled asthma. You also mentioned green/ yellow phlegm which is suggestive of infection resulting in exacerbation of asthma. As you told he is having the symptoms despite having ruler(formoterl-mometasone) so shifting to forecourt (formoterl-budesonide) or Aeroflot (salmeterol-fluticasone) may be a better option. Oral Prednisolone should not be used on a long term basis. It will make asthma dependent on steroid as well lead to many systemic side effects. There are many causes of difficult to control asthma.

By doing the SPT we can detect the allergen, and you can avoid allergen causing these symptoms. If you cannot avoid the allergen like food you can go for immunotherapy.

It is best to use cough etiquette when you are around other people-cough or sneeze into your shoulder (not your palms), or into a tissue which you dispose. As for the brownish phlegm, if your fever is settling and you're getting better overall, there's no need to worry about them. If you have difficulty breathing or a temperature more than 102 F, contact your physician. I suggest you take some anti histamines and montelukast if you are prone to allergies, as the climate will exacerbate your allergies.

However, this may seem but is usually not the case. What happens is that your allergies are getting worse, and once a day cetirizine is insufficient to make a difference to the symptoms. Avil injection is a short-acting but rapidly acting antihistamine with sedative properties and will NOT recommend this for long term use. You must get a blood test or specific IGE OR a skin prick test to find out what your allergies are. If it is house dust mite, avoidance measures should be in place but optimizing medical treatment with long acting antihistamines like Allegra and nasal corticosteroid sprays are recommended.

I would like to tell you one thing about the treatment of allergy. The only effective treatment of Allergy is avoidance of allergen (Triggering factor). Any substance could be an allergen. Most common allergens for NASA bronchial allergy are dust and pollen. As far as the monteluKast is concerned - this is not useful in treating acute attack of allergy. It will help in reducing the frequency of allergic episodes. For it to be effective you might have to use it for years (2-3 Years). In very rare cases may have to be used for very long periods. Rota caps will give you instant relief but will not affect the recurrence of allergic episodes. The only definitive treatment as I have mentioned earlier is avoidance of allergen. Just list out all the possible allergens with which you experience allergy. Try to avoid those allergens. Try using a cloth mask while going out. Using newer antihistamines like Fexofenadine 120 mg (Allegra) will help you to counter acute attacks. Get your Blood Eosinophil count done. Based on the result. You can use some medicines like DEC (Di Ethyl carbamide) which reduces the eosinophils and will prevent recurrent attacks of nasobronchial allergy. But please discuss with your doctor before you start using DEC. Hope you got some solution. Wish you a healthy day Take care",1,"dust, pollen",Environmental

But allergy should be treated in stepwise manner first if your symptoms is for few months a year like 2-3 months then you start an antihistamine which you have to take daily at night. If your symptoms still persist then your start using steroid nasal spray, it has no side effect, and it controls the allergy very well, and you should start 2 weeks before your symptoms start. If this also does not cure you.

That you have had it for >6 weeks, makes it chronic urticaria. 80% of people with urticaria do not have allergy, although a pre-existing allergy to (say) house dust mite, pollen or shrimp does not make it more likely for this type of urticaria to appear. Infections, underlying thyroid problems, diabetes, inflammation inside the body (can be several conditions, say endometriosis) and stress makes these lesions appear and can last quite long. The treatment (that you don't like) is the right one, long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like Allegra 180\u00a0mg once in the morning, and cetirizine 10\u00a0mg at lunchtime or evening for 6 weeks (max 3 months).
